# Spec Chain - AI-Powered Documentation Generator

A comprehensive system of AI prompts that work together to generate complete product documentation from a single app idea. This repository contains the spec-chain methodology for creating full documentation suites using AI with optimized parallel execution and simplified file-based operations.

**Use spec-chain in any project:** Simply run `/init-spec-chain` in any directory to initialize it for spec-chain usage. All generated content is isolated in a `spec-chain` directory for portability and clean project organization.

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Using npm (global installation):**
```bash
npm install -g claude-spec-chain
claude-spec-chain install
```

**Using shell script (Linux/macOS/WSL):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/spec-chain/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Note:** Claude Code runs on Linux. Windows users should use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

**Deployment Note:** For clean deployment, only the core spec-chain commands are included in packages. The `prime.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files are development-specific and should be customized per project if needed.

### Other Installation Methods

**Download and extract:**
1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/spec-chain/releases)
2. Extract the `.claude` directory to your project root
3. Open your project in Claude Code

**Git clone:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spec-chain.git
cp -r spec-chain/.claude your-project/
```

**Global installation with shell script:**
```bash
# Install globally to ~/.claude-commands/spec-chain
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/spec-chain/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --global

# Then in any project:
claude-spec-chain install
```

## 🚀 What is Spec Chain?

Spec Chain is a collection of 9 carefully crafted AI prompts that generate 8 core documents with iterative validation for comprehensive software documentation. Each prompt is designed to produce specific documentation that builds upon previous outputs, creating a complete specification suite. All documentation is generated from a single `APP_DETAILS.md` file and optional inspiration materials.

### ⚡ **New in v3.0**: Isolated Project Structure
- **Isolated Generation**: All spec-chain files now live in `spec-chain/` directory
- **Portable Commands**: Initialize and run spec-chain in any project directory
- **Easy Verification**: Simple check for `spec-chain/` directory confirms initialization
- **Any Directory**: Works in any folder after running `/init-spec-chain`

### **v2.0 Features**: Simplified Execution & Parallel Processing
- **File-Based Architecture**: All prompts now use simplified file-based loading instead of complex argument passing
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent documents generate simultaneously, reducing total time by 25-33%
- **Single Argument Interface**: All prompts now only require the spec name as an argument
- **Self-Contained Operations**: Each prompt handles its own file loading and persistence internally

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Initialize your project**:
   ```bash
   /init-spec-chain
   ```
   This creates the required directory structure and APP_DETAILS.md template.

2. **Create your APP_DETAILS.md**:
   - The template is automatically created by `/init-spec-chain`
   - Fill out the required fields (App Name, App Idea, MVP Features, Target Users)
   - Optional fields can be left blank - they will be auto-researched
   - **Note**: If APP_DETAILS.md is incomplete, `/run-spec-chain` will interactively gather missing information

3. **Add inspiration materials** (optional):
   - Visual references → `/assets/inspiration/visual/`
   - Functional examples → `/assets/inspiration/functional/`

4. **Validate your setup**:
   ```bash
   /validate-spec-chain
   ```

5. **Generate documentation**:
   ```bash
   /run-spec-chain
   ```

## 📋 Available Documentation Generators

## 🔄 Documentation Flow

```
Initial Idea → PRD → Business/Design/Technical → Implementation → Operations
```

The runner now uses **parallel execution** to generate multiple documents concurrently, optimizing total generation time. See the complete flow diagram below for detailed dependencies.

## 🎯 How to Use Spec Chain

### Quick Start (Minimal Documentation)
```bash
1. Use doc-prompt-prd.md with your app idea
2. Use doc-prompt-technical.md with the PRD output
3. Use doc-prompt-planner.md for development plan (with validation)
```

### Full Documentation Suite
```bash
1. Fill out APP_DETAILS.md with your project information
2. Optionally add inspiration materials to /assets/inspiration/
3. Run /validate-spec-chain to ensure setup is correct
4. Execute /run-spec-chain to generate all documentation
5. Review generated documents in /specs/[spec-name]/
6. Iterate on APP_DETAILS.md and regenerate as needed
```

### For Claude Code Users
The `doc-prompt-planner.md` prompt is specifically optimized for AI-assisted development, breaking work into clear, manageable sessions. The implementation plan now includes iterative validation to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## 📊 Documentation Flow Diagram

The Spec Chain runner executes prompts in optimized phases with parallel execution:

```
Phase 1: Foundation (1 prompt)
    └── PRD.md

Phase 2: Feature Analysis & Technical Overview (2 prompts - parallel)
    ├── FEATURE_STORIES.md
    └── TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md (depends on PRD)

Phase 3: Design & UI/UX (3 prompts - sequential)
    ├── STYLE_GUIDE.md
    ├── UI_STATES.md (depends on Style Guide)
    └── UI_PREVIEW.html (depends on Style Guide and UI States)

Phase 4: Technical Architecture (1 prompt - sequential)
    └── TECHNICAL_SPEC.md (depends on Technical Overview)

Phase 5: Planning & Implementation Rules (2 steps - sequential)
    ├── 5.1: Load Playbooks and Rules (depends on Technical Spec)
    └── 5.2: Generate Implementation Plan with Iterative Validation (depends on Playbooks)
         └── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (with up to 5 validation iterations)
```

**Key:** Prompts marked as PARALLEL execute concurrently using Task agents

## 🔐 Permissions Configuration

**Claude Code will automatically ask for permissions as spec-chain runs** - you can simply approve each request as it appears. However, if you prefer to set up permissions in advance for a smoother experience, here's a sample `.claude/settings.local.json` configuration that covers the initial permissions required to make spec-chain run smoothly:

**Optional: Pre-configure permissions in `.claude/settings.local.json`:**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read(spec-chain/**)",
      "Write(spec-chain/**)",
      "Edit(spec-chain/**)",
      "MultiEdit(spec-chain/**)",
      "Bash(mkdir:spec-chain/**)",
      "Bash(ls:spec-chain/**)",
      "Bash(pwd)",
      "Bash(cp:spec-chain/**)",
      "Bash(echo:*)",
      "Bash(date)",
      "Bash(test:spec-chain/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note:** 
- If this file doesn't exist, create it in your project's `.claude/` directory
- Restart Claude Code after adding permissions for them to take effect
- These permissions allow spec-chain to create and manage its isolated `spec-chain/` directory structure
- You can also just run spec-chain without pre-configuring - Claude will ask for each permission as needed

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is the difference between spec-chain and other documentation generators?**
A: Spec-chain is specifically designed for Claude Code and uses AI prompts that work together to generate comprehensive, consistent documentation from a single APP_DETAILS.md file. It includes parallel execution, iterative validation, and isolated project structure.

**Q: Can I use spec-chain with other AI systems besides Claude?**
A: Spec-chain is optimized for Claude Code, but the prompts could potentially be adapted for other AI systems. However, features like parallel execution and Claude Code integration would need to be reimplemented.

**Q: Do I need to fill out every field in APP_DETAILS.md?**
A: No! Only the basic information fields are required. Optional fields can be left blank and will be auto-researched or use sensible defaults. The `/run-spec-chain` command can interactively gather missing information.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why does spec-chain use a `spec-chain/` directory?**
A: This keeps all spec-chain files isolated from your project, making it portable and ensuring your existing project structure remains clean. You can initialize spec-chain in any directory without affecting existing files.

**Q: Can I customize the generated documentation?**
A: Yes! You can:
- Modify APP_DETAILS.md and regenerate
- Add inspiration materials to influence output
- Edit individual prompts in `.claude/commands/spec-chain/`
- Add custom playbooks in `spec-chain/assets/playbooks/`

**Q: How does parallel execution work?**
A: Independent documents (like feature stories and technical overview) generate simultaneously using Claude's Task agents, reducing total generation time by 25-33%.

### Installation Questions

**Q: Which installation method should I use?**
A: For most users, the npm method (`npm install -g claude-spec-chain`) is recommended as it provides easy updates and a consistent experience across platforms.

**Q: Can I install spec-chain on Windows?**
A: Yes, but you must use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) since Claude Code only runs on Linux. Install WSL first, then use any Linux installation method.

**Q: What if I get permission errors?**
A: Claude Code will ask for permissions as needed. You can approve them individually, or pre-configure permissions in `.claude/settings.local.json` for a smoother experience.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Denied Errors
**Problem**: Cannot create `spec-chain/` directory or files
**Solution**: 
1. Let Claude Code ask for permissions and approve them
2. Or pre-configure permissions in `.claude/settings.local.json` (see [Permissions Configuration](#permissions-configuration))
3. Restart Claude Code after adding permissions

#### Commands Not Recognized
**Problem**: `/init-spec-chain` or other commands not found
**Solution**:
1. Ensure `.claude/commands/spec-chain/` directory exists
2. Check that command files are present in the directory
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Verify you're in the correct project directory
