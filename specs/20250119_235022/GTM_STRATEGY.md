## Clarification Requests or Feedback

1. **Microsoft Partnership Strategy**: What level of official Microsoft endorsement or partnership should we pursue, and what concessions might be required?

2. **Open Source Monetization**: Should we consider a "open core" model where certain features are proprietary, or maintain full open source with monetization only through support/services?

3. **Geographic Expansion**: Which international markets should be prioritized after US success, considering Azure's global presence?

4. **Channel Strategy**: Should we build a partner channel program for consultancies and system integrators from day one, or focus on direct sales initially?

5. **Competitive Positioning**: How aggressively should we position against Microsoft's own tools vs. positioning as complementary?
