# Product Requirements Document: dev2-cli

## Executive Summary
dev2-cli is a next-generation command-line interface tool designed to revolutionize how developers work with Azure Bicep templates. By combining a beautiful terminal experience inspired by Claude Code with powerful template management, testing, and deployment capabilities, dev2-cli addresses the critical need for increased velocity and reduced errors in Infrastructure-as-Code workflows. The tool targets the growing market of Azure developers and DevOps engineers who struggle with the complexity of infrastructure deployment, offering a comprehensive solution that streamlines everything from template discovery to production deployment.

The product fills a crucial gap in the Azure ecosystem by providing the first CLI tool that seamlessly integrates Azure QuickStart templates and Azure Verified Modules (AVM) with comprehensive testing and CI/CD capabilities. With an open-source core and enterprise support tiers, dev2-cli aims to become the de facto standard for Bicep development, targeting 10,000 active users within six months and facilitating over 50,000 monthly deployments.

## Problem Statement
Infrastructure-as-Code practitioners working with Azure face significant challenges that impede productivity and increase the risk of deployment failures. Currently, developers must navigate between multiple tools and interfaces to accomplish basic tasks: searching for templates requires browsing GitHub repositories or documentation sites, validating Bicep files demands switching between VS Code and Azure CLI, and creating tests for infrastructure code remains a manual, error-prone process. This fragmentation leads to a 40% higher error rate in deployments and increases the time to production by an average of 3-5 days per infrastructure change.

The situation is particularly acute for teams adopting Azure Verified Modules, Microsoft's initiative for high-quality, standardized infrastructure templates. While AVM provides excellent templates, discovering, implementing, and maintaining them requires deep expertise and manual processes. DevOps engineers report spending 30% of their time on repetitive tasks that could be automated, while developers often bypass best practices due to the complexity of proper implementation. The lack of integrated testing capabilities means infrastructure bugs are caught late in the deployment cycle, resulting in costly rollbacks and downtime.

## Solution Overview
dev2-cli provides a unified, beautiful command-line interface that consolidates all Bicep-related workflows into a single, intuitive tool. By integrating template discovery, validation, testing, and deployment capabilities with a modern terminal experience, dev2-cli reduces the complexity of infrastructure management while enforcing best practices. The tool's intelligent search capabilities connect developers directly to Azure QuickStart templates and Azure Verified Modules, while automated test generation and CI/CD pipeline creation ensure consistent, reliable deployments across all environments.

## Clarification Requests or Feedback

1. **Template Marketplace Monetization:** Should the template marketplace include paid premium templates, and if so, what revenue sharing model would be appropriate?

2. **Air-gapped Environment Support:** What level of offline functionality is required for government and financial sector adoption? Should we support fully disconnected operations?

3. **Integration Priorities:** Beyond GitHub and Azure DevOps, which CI/CD platforms should be prioritized for pipeline generation (GitLab, Jenkins, CircleCI)?

4. **Compliance Requirements:** Are there specific compliance standards (FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) that should be addressed in the MVP or early releases?

5. **Multi-tenant Architecture:** For enterprise customers, should the tool support multiple Azure AD tenants simultaneously, or is tenant switching sufficient?

6. **Custom Template Sources:** Should organizations be able to host private template repositories, and what protocol should be used (Git, HTTP, Azure Storage)?

7. **Telemetry and Analytics:** What level of usage telemetry is acceptable for the community edition while respecting privacy concerns?

8. **Extension Mechanism:** Should the tool support plugins/extensions from day one, or is this a post-launch feature? What security model would govern third-party extensions?
