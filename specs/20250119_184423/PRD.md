# Product Requirements Document: BIG Live Portal

## Executive Summary

BIG Live Portal is a browser-based web application designed to transform how performing arts organizations manage their relationships with artists and contractors. The platform addresses the critical pain points of paper-based contract management, manual expense processing, and fragmented communication channels that plague the performing arts industry. By providing a unified, mobile-responsive portal accessible through personal email addresses, BIG Live Portal enables artists to easily access contracts, submit expenses, and view schedules while giving administrators powerful tools to manage operations without requiring external IT support.

The solution targets a growing market opportunity in the performing arts management software sector, currently valued at $42.8 billion and projected to reach $67.2 billion by 2030. With its focus on reducing administrative overhead by 40-60% and eliminating paper processes, BIG Live Portal positions itself as an essential tool for small to medium performing arts organizations looking to modernize their operations while maintaining the personal touch that defines the creative industries.

## Problem Statement

Performing arts organizations currently face significant operational challenges that impact both their administrative efficiency and artist satisfaction:

**Current pain points:**
- Manual, paper-based contract management leads to lost documents, delayed signatures, and compliance risks
- Expense reimbursement processes take weeks or months, causing financial stress for artists
- Schedule changes are communicated through fragmented channels (email, text, bulletin boards), leading to missed performances
- Administrative staff spend 30-40% of their time on repetitive paperwork instead of creative support
- Artists struggle with multiple login credentials across different systems
- Mobile artists on tour cannot easily access important documents or submit expenses
- Lack of integration between document storage, financial systems, and communication tools

**Market gaps:**
- Existing solutions are either too complex (Theatre Manager) or too expensive (Gigwell at $149-599/month)
- Most platforms require corporate email addresses, which independent artists rarely have
- Current tools focus on venues rather than artist needs
- Limited mobile functionality in existing solutions
- High dependency on IT departments for maintenance

**User frustrations:**
- Artists: "I lost my contract copy and can't remember what I agreed to"
- Administrators: "I spend hours chasing signatures and matching receipts to claims"
- Accountants: "Processing expenses manually means artists wait months for reimbursement"
- Managers: "I have no visibility into whether artists received schedule updates"

**Business opportunities:**
- 5.2 million arts workers in the US alone need better management tools
- Digital transformation in creative industries accelerating post-pandemic
- Growing demand for mobile-accessible solutions for touring artists
- Opportunity to reduce operational costs while improving artist satisfaction

## Solution Overview

BIG Live Portal provides a comprehensive, cloud-based platform that centralizes all artist-organization interactions into a single, intuitive interface. The solution leverages existing infrastructure (SharePoint) while adding purpose-built features for the performing arts industry. By focusing on mobile responsiveness and using personal email addresses for authentication, the platform meets artists where they are - on their phones, on tour, between rehearsals. The system's modular architecture allows organizations to start with basic features and expand as needed, ensuring accessibility for organizations of all sizes and budgets.

## Clarification Requests or Feedback

1. **E-signature Integration Preference**: Would you prefer DocuSign or Adobe Sign as the primary e-signature provider? Both are mentioned but having a primary choice would help with initial implementation.

2. **SharePoint Version**: The requirements mention both SharePoint Online and On-premises (2019+). Which is the primary target? This affects authentication approach and API capabilities.

3. **Expense Approval Workflow**: Should expense approval workflows be configurable per organization (different approval limits, multiple approvers) or follow a standard single-approver model in MVP?

4. **Artist Types**: Beyond dancers, actors, and musicians, are there other artist types that need specific features or fields?

5. **Notification Preferences**: Should artists be able to opt-out of certain notification types, or are some notifications mandatory (like contract assignments)?

6. **Data Retention**: What is the required retention period for different data types (contracts, expenses, audit logs)? This affects storage planning and compliance features.

7. **Multi-Organization Support**: Should artists be able to work with multiple organizations through a single account, or separate accounts per organization?

8. **Currency Support**: The requirements mention multi-currency for Phase 3, but should the MVP support currency display preferences even if transactions are in a single currency?

9. **Schedule Integration**: Should the platform support importing schedules from specific external sources (Google Calendar, Outlook, specific venue management systems)?

10. **Reporting Requirements**: What specific reports are most critical for the admin dashboard in MVP vs. future phases?
