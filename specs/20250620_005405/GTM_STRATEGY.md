# Go-to-Market Strategy: BIG Live Portal

## Executive Summary

BIG Live Portal enters the performing arts technology market at an inflection point where organizations are embracing digital transformation while seeking solutions that understand their unique operational challenges. Our go-to-market strategy targets small to medium performing arts organizations (50-500 artists) with a product-led growth approach that emphasizes rapid time-to-value, minimal IT requirements, and demonstrable ROI through administrative time savings.

The strategy focuses on capturing 50 organizations in Year 1 from a serviceable addressable market of 2,000 digitally-ready arts organizations across English-speaking markets. By positioning BIG Live Portal as the artist-friendly alternative to complex enterprise systems and manual processes, we project $1.2M ARR by Year 1, $3.5M by Year 2, and $8M by Year 3. Success hinges on achieving 80% artist adoption rates, delivering 75% faster expense reimbursements, and maintaining a Net Promoter Score above 40.

Our phased approach begins with a soft launch to 3-5 friendly organizations, followed by a public launch at major performing arts conferences, and expansion through strategic partnerships with arts service organizations. The self-service model for smaller organizations combined with white-glove onboarding for larger clients ensures scalable growth while maintaining the high-touch support that arts organizations require.
