# Information Architecture: BIG Live Portal

## Overview
The BIG Live Portal information architecture is designed to provide intuitive navigation and content organization for a diverse user base in the performing arts industry. The IA follows a role-based, task-oriented approach that prioritizes the most frequent workflows while maintaining scalability for future features. The architecture emphasizes mobile-first navigation patterns, progressive disclosure of complexity, and clear wayfinding to reduce cognitive load for artists who primarily access the platform between rehearsals and performances.

## IA Principles

1. **Role-Based Visibility**: Content and navigation adapt based on user permissions (Artist, Admin, Accountant, Production Manager), showing only relevant features to reduce complexity
2. **Task-Oriented Organization**: Primary navigation reflects key workflows rather than data types, enabling users to quickly accomplish their goals
3. **Mobile-First Hierarchy**: Navigation structure prioritizes thumb-friendly access patterns and reduces depth for critical artist functions
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features and administrative functions are revealed contextually, keeping the interface simple for basic users

## User Mental Models

### Artist (Sarah Chen)
- **Primary Goals**: View contracts, submit expenses, check schedule, get paid quickly
- **Mental Model**: Thinks in terms of productions and time - "What do I need to do today?" and "When will I get paid?"
- **Key Paths**: Dashboard ‚Üí Contracts/Expenses/Schedule (single-click access to all critical functions)
- **Terminology**: Production names, rehearsal/performance, reimbursement (not "expense claim")

### Operations Administrator (Michael Thompson)
- **Primary Goals**: Process contracts, manage artists, update schedules, maintain smooth operations
- **Mental Model**: Workflow-based thinking - queues of tasks to complete, status tracking, bulk operations
- **Key Paths**: Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Approval Queues ‚Üí User Management
- **Terminology**: Contracts, artists (not "users"), productions, approval workflows

### Finance Administrator (Priya Patel)
- **Primary Goals**: Approve expenses quickly, maintain audit trail, integrate with accounting systems
- **Mental Model**: Financial periods and approval hierarchies - monthly cycles, verification requirements
- **Key Paths**: Dashboard ‚Üí Expense Approvals ‚Üí Reports
- **Terminology**: Claims, reimbursements, approval queue, payment batch

### Production Manager
- **Primary Goals**: Communicate schedule changes, post announcements, manage production-specific information
- **Mental Model**: Production-centric view - everything organized by show
- **Key Paths**: Dashboard ‚Üí Schedule Management ‚Üí Announcements
- **Terminology**: Call times, rehearsals, performances, cast communications

|---------|--------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Dashboard | Personal view | Operations view | Financial view | Production view |
| Contracts | Own only | All contracts | View only | Production specific |
| Expenses | Own only | All expenses | Approval queue | View only |
| Schedule | Assigned events | All events | None | Edit capability |
| Admin Tools | None | Full access | Expense approvals | Schedule management |
| Reports | None | Full access | Financial only | Production only |

### Adaptive Navigation
- Hide unavailable sections based on role
- Show role-specific quick actions
- Contextual help based on permissions
- Permission-based data filtering

## Mobile IA Considerations

### Mobile-First Sections
Priority order for mobile navigation:
1. Dashboard (home/overview)
2. Contracts (critical for artists)
3. Expenses (frequent use)
4. Schedule (daily reference)
5. More... (Profile, Help, Admin if applicable)

### Mobile-Specific Patterns
- Bottom tab navigation for top 4 sections
- Hamburger menu for full navigation
- Swipe gestures for date navigation in schedule
- Pull-to-refresh for real-time updates
- Contextual actions in sticky headers

## Growth & Scalability

### IA Extension Points
1. **New Features**: Add as subsections under logical parent
2. **New Content Types**: Create primary section if significant
3. **Integrations**: Add under Admin tools
4. **Advanced Features**: Progressive disclosure in existing sections

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Multi-organization support (organization switcher)
- [ ] Advanced reporting module (dedicated section)
- [ ] Messaging system (new primary section)
- [ ] Resource booking (under Schedule)
- [ ] Training modules (under Help)

## Clarification Requests or Feedback

1. **Multi-Production Artists**: Additional detail on how navigation should adapt for artists working multiple simultaneous productions would help optimize the filtering and context-switching experience.

2. **Notification Architecture**: Clarification on the notification system's scope (in-app only vs. email/SMS routing) would inform whether notifications deserve a dedicated section or remain utility-level.

3. **Archive Strategy**: Guidance on when contracts and expenses move to archive status and how users access historical data would help design the archive navigation pattern.

4. **Production Hierarchy**: Understanding if productions have sub-categories (e.g., main stage vs. workshop) would inform whether additional navigation hierarchy is needed.

5. **Dashboard Customization**: Confirmation on whether users should be able to customize their dashboard widgets would impact the IA's flexibility requirements.

6. **Cross-Organization Access**: For artists working with multiple organizations using the platform, clarification on organization switching patterns would inform the global navigation design.

7. **Seasonal Navigation**: Details on how navigation might adapt during peak seasons vs. off-seasons would help design temporal navigation patterns.
