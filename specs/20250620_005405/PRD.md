# Product Requirements Document: BIG Live Portal

## Executive Summary

BIG Live Portal is a purpose-built web application designed to streamline administrative workflows between performing artists and arts organizations. The platform addresses the unique challenges of managing distributed talent by providing a centralized, mobile-friendly solution for contract management, expense processing, and schedule coordination. Unlike generic HR or project management tools, BIG Live Portal understands the specific needs of the performing arts industry, where artists often work as independent contractors across multiple productions.

The platform eliminates the current fragmentation of email-based contracts, spreadsheet expense tracking, and disparate scheduling systems. By providing artists with personalized dashboards accessible via their personal email addresses, and giving administrators powerful yet simple management tools, BIG Live Portal reduces administrative overhead by 50% while improving transparency and artist satisfaction.

Expected to launch with 50-200 artists initially, the platform is designed to scale to 1,000+ users within two years, targeting small to medium performing arts organizations with annual budgets between $1M-$10M. The solution's emphasis on mobile responsiveness, integration with existing tools like SharePoint and Xero, and maintenance simplicity positions it as the ideal choice for arts organizations seeking digital transformation without IT complexity.

## Problem Statement

Performing arts organizations face significant administrative challenges in managing their distributed workforce of artists, who typically work as independent contractors across multiple productions. Current pain points include:

**Current Pain Points:**
- Contract management relies on email chains, making it difficult to track signatures, versions, and deadlines
- Expense reimbursement uses manual processes with paper receipts and Excel spreadsheets, causing delays of 30-60 days
- Schedule updates are communicated through various channels (email, SMS, bulletin boards), leading to missed rehearsals and confusion
- Artists lack centralized access to their administrative information, creating anxiety and frequent support requests
- Administrators spend 15-20 hours weekly on repetitive tasks that could be automated

**Market Gaps:**
- Existing arts management platforms (Overture, Theatre Manager) focus on ticketing and patron management, treating artist management as an afterthought
- Generic HR platforms don't understand contractor workflows or the project-based nature of performing arts
- No solution provides artist-friendly mobile access without requiring app downloads
- Current tools require significant IT support, which most arts organizations cannot afford

**User Frustrations:**
- Artists feel disconnected from administrative processes, unsure about contract status or payment timelines
- Administrators juggle multiple systems and manual processes, leading to errors and burnout
- Finance teams struggle with paper-based expense workflows and lack of integration with accounting systems
- Production managers have no efficient way to communicate schedule changes to specific artist groups

**Business Opportunities:**
- Post-pandemic digital transformation has created openness to new solutions
- Growing gig economy increases demand for contractor-friendly platforms
- Arts organizations seek to improve artist experience to attract and retain talent
- Opportunity to become the industry standard for artist management

## Solution Overview

BIG Live Portal provides a unified, web-based platform that centralizes all administrative interactions between performing artists and arts organizations. The solution leverages modern web technologies to deliver a mobile-first experience that requires no app installation, ensuring maximum accessibility for artists of all technical abilities. By integrating with existing infrastructure (SharePoint for documents, Xero for finance), the platform enhances rather than replaces current investments. The emphasis on role-based access, automated workflows, and real-time notifications transforms previously manual, error-prone processes into streamlined digital experiences that save time, reduce costs, and improve satisfaction for all stakeholders.

## Clarification Requests or Feedback

1. **E-signature Provider Preference:** While the requirements mention both Microsoft and Adobe Sign, a specific preference would help optimize the integration approach and potentially reduce costs through volume licensing.

2. **SharePoint Structure:** Understanding the current SharePoint folder structure and permissions model would enable more efficient integration design and ensure compatibility with existing organizational practices.

3. **Xero Integration Depth:** Clarification on whether the integration should create draft bills, approved bills, or fully processed payments would help define the exact workflow and required permissions.

4. **Union Regulations:** Specific union rules regarding contractor management, especially around hours tracking and payment schedules, would ensure compliance from day one.

5. **Data Retention Policies:** While 7 years is mentioned for financial records, clarification on contract and general document retention would help design appropriate archival strategies.

6. **Performance Season Patterns:** Understanding typical performance season patterns (e.g., fall heavy, summer light) would help design scaling strategies and pricing models that accommodate usage fluctuations.

7. **Multi-Company Artist Scenarios:** More details on how artists who work with multiple organizations using the platform should be handled would inform the account model and data isolation approach.
