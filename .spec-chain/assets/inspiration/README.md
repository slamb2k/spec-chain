# Visual Inspiration Assets

Place visual design references here. Claude can analyze these directly:

**Images (PNG/JPG/GIF)**:
- Screenshots showing design styles and emotional tone
- UI examples demonstrating visual principles
- Color palette examples (for mood, not copying)
- Animation GIFs showing motion principles
- Typography examples showing personality

**HTML Files**:
- Component examples with CSS styles
- Animation and interaction implementations
- Responsive design demonstrations
- Design system code examples

**PDF Files**:
- Brand guidelines for inspiration
- Design system documentation
- Style guide examples
- Visual design case studies

**Remember**: These are creative springboards, not templates. Claude will:
- Extract principles and emotions, not copy exact designs
- Learn from what works and imagine better solutions
- Synthesize multiple inspirations into original designs
- Create something uniquely suited to your project
