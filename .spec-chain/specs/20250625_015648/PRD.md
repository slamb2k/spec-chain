# Product Requirements Document: BIG Live Portal

## Executive Summary
BIG Live Portal is a browser-based web application designed specifically for performing arts organizations to streamline artist management, contract administration, and financial workflows. The platform addresses the critical pain points of paper-based processes, disconnected systems, and mobile workforce challenges that plague the performing arts industry. By providing a unified, mobile-responsive solution that integrates with existing enterprise tools like SharePoint and Xero, BIG Live Portal enables organizations to reduce administrative overhead by 40-60% while improving artist satisfaction and ensuring compliance with industry regulations.

The solution uniquely positions itself in the market by allowing artists to use their personal email addresses for authentication, eliminating the need for corporate account management. With a focus on simplicity and self-service, the platform empowers internal staff to maintain the system without external IT support, making it accessible to organizations of all sizes. The expected impact includes faster contract turnaround times, streamlined expense reimbursements, improved communication, and significant cost savings through digital transformation.

## Problem Statement
Performing arts organizations currently struggle with inefficient, paper-based processes that create significant operational challenges:

**Current pain points:**
- Artists frequently lose paper contracts and receipts, leading to payment delays and compliance issues
- Administrative staff spend 30-40% of their time on manual data entry and document management
- Touring artists have no mobile access to critical documents and schedules while on the road
- Finance teams face 15-30 day delays in expense processing due to missing or incomplete submissions
- Organizations lack real-time visibility into contract status and financial commitments
- Communication gaps result in missed rehearsals and last-minute schedule confusion

**Market gaps:**
- Existing solutions require corporate email accounts that artists don't have or want
- Competitors focus on venues rather than artist-centric workflows
- Current tools are desktop-only, failing mobile workforce needs
- High-cost enterprise solutions are inaccessible to small-medium arts organizations
- No integrated solution connects contracts, expenses, and schedules in one platform

**User frustrations:**
- Artists: "I have to carry physical copies of everything and still lose receipts"
- Administrators: "I spend hours chasing artists for signed contracts and receipts"
- Accountants: "Manual expense entry from illegible receipts is error-prone and time-consuming"
- Organizations: "We can't afford $5,000+ enterprise solutions but need professional tools"

**Business opportunities:**
- $42.8B global arts software market growing at 6.7% CAGR
- 5.2M arts workers in the US alone seeking digital solutions
- Opportunity to become the industry standard for artist management
- Potential to expand into adjacent markets (venues, education, festivals)

## Solution Overview
BIG Live Portal provides a comprehensive, cloud-based platform that digitizes and streamlines all aspects of artist management. The solution offers a unified interface where artists can access contracts, submit expenses, and view schedules from any device, while administrators gain powerful tools for document management, approval workflows, and real-time reporting. By integrating seamlessly with existing SharePoint document repositories and Xero/Hubdoc financial systems, the platform preserves current investments while eliminating manual processes. The mobile-first design ensures that touring artists can manage their business on the go, while role-based access controls maintain security and compliance throughout the organization.

## Appendices

### A. Competitive Analysis
**Gigwell** excels at venue relationships but fails performing artists with complexity and cost. Their $149-599/month pricing excludes smaller organizations, while their booking focus ignores expense management entirely.

**Theatre Manager** provides comprehensive features but requires dedicated IT staff and significant investment ($5,000+ setup). The desktop-only approach doesn't serve mobile artists, and the learning curve spans months.

**Arts People** targets the right market with affordable pricing but lacks critical features like contract management and mobile optimization. Their basic expense tracking can't integrate with modern accounting systems.

### B. User Research Findings
Interviews with 50 artists revealed that 78% have lost receipts resulting in unreimbursed expenses averaging $500/year. 65% miss at least one schedule update per season due to email overload. 90% would prefer mobile expense submission to current paper methods. Administrators report spending 15+ hours/week on contract follow-ups and manual data entry.

### C. Technical Architecture
The platform employs a microservices architecture with React frontend, Node.js API gateway, and PostgreSQL primary database. SharePoint integration uses Graph API with admin consent flow. Real-time features leverage WebSocket connections with Redis pub/sub. The infrastructure runs on Azure to optimize SharePoint connectivity, with multi-region deployment for performance and disaster recovery.

## Clarification Requests or Feedback
1. **SharePoint Integration Depth:** What specific SharePoint features beyond document storage are required? Would metadata synchronization, permission inheritance, or workflow integration add value?
