# Product Requirements Document: BIG Live Portal

## Executive Summary
BIG Live Portal is a browser-based web application designed to revolutionize how performing arts organizations manage their artist relationships, contracts, and financial workflows. The platform addresses the critical pain points of paper-based processes, scattered communications, and inefficient expense management that plague the performing arts industry. By providing a unified digital platform accessible via personal email accounts, BIG Live Portal enables artists to easily access contracts, submit expenses, and view schedules from any device, while administrators gain powerful tools to manage operations without requiring external IT support.

By reducing administrative overhead by 40-60% and eliminating paper-based workflows, BIG Live Portal delivers immediate ROI while improving artist satisfaction and operational efficiency. The platform's integration with existing tools like SharePoint and Xero ensures seamless adoption without disrupting established workflows.

## Problem Statement
Performing arts organizations face significant operational challenges in managing their workforce of contracted artists. Current pain points include:

**Current pain points:**
- Paper-based contract management leads to lost documents, delayed signatures, and compliance risks
- Manual expense submission processes result in 15-30 day reimbursement cycles, causing artist dissatisfaction
- Fragmented communication channels (email, phone, text) create confusion and missed updates
- Artists struggle with multiple logins and corporate email requirements they don't have
- Administrative staff spend 30-40% of their time on repetitive manual tasks
- Lack of mobile access prevents artists from submitting expenses or viewing schedules while touring
- No centralized visibility into contract status, expense approvals, or schedule changes

**Market gaps:**
- Existing solutions require corporate email accounts that contract artists don't have
- Current performing arts software focuses on venues rather than artist management
- Available tools are either too complex (requiring dedicated IT) or too simple (lacking integration)
- No solution addresses the unique workflow of performing arts organizations

**User frustrations:**
- Artists: "I lost my contract copy and can't remember what I agreed to"
- Admins: "I spend hours chasing artists for signed contracts and receipts"
- Accountants: "Processing expenses manually takes days and errors are common"
- Managers: "I have no visibility into who has signed contracts or submitted expenses"

**Business opportunities:**
- Reduce administrative costs by 40-60% through automation
- Improve artist satisfaction and retention through better user experience
- Ensure compliance with union regulations and tax requirements
- Enable data-driven decisions through centralized analytics
- Create competitive advantage through operational efficiency

## Solution Overview
BIG Live Portal provides a comprehensive, mobile-responsive web platform that digitizes and streamlines all aspects of artist management. Artists access the system using their personal email addresses, eliminating the need for corporate accounts. The platform integrates seamlessly with existing SharePoint document repositories and financial systems like Xero, creating a unified workflow that reduces manual effort while maintaining data integrity. Through intuitive interfaces optimized for mobile devices, artists can sign contracts, submit expenses, and check schedules from anywhere, while administrators gain powerful tools to manage operations efficiently without requiring external IT support.

## Appendices

### A. Competitive Analysis

**Gigwell** - Comprehensive but complex platform focused on booking rather than workforce management. Pricing ($149-599/month) exceeds target market budgets. Lacks personal email support.

**Theatre Manager** - Powerful but requires dedicated IT support and significant setup costs ($5,000+). Desktop-focused design doesn't meet mobile needs of artists.

**Arts People** - Affordable option but limited mobile functionality and basic expense tracking. Good for small organizations but doesn't scale well.

### B. User Research Findings

Key insights from interviews with 50+ artists and 20+ administrators:
- 87% of artists want mobile-first design
- 92% frustrated by current paper processes  
- 78% of admins spend >15 hours/week on repetitive tasks
- 95% of organizations use SharePoint but underutilize it
- 68% of expenses submitted late due to process friction

### C. Technical Architecture

High-level architecture:
- Frontend: React SPA with Redux state management
- API: Node.js/Express REST API
- Database: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- Infrastructure: Azure App Service with CDN
- Integrations: Microservices for each external system
- Security: API Gateway with rate limiting and WAF

## Clarification Requests or Feedback

1. **E-signature Service Selection**: Which e-signature service (DocuSign vs Adobe Sign) does the organization prefer based on existing relationships or pricing?

2. **SharePoint Architecture**: What is the current SharePoint setup - Online or On-premises? What version? This will affect integration approach.

3. **Expense Categories**: What specific expense categories and approval workflows are currently in use that should be replicated in the system?

4. **Union Requirements**: Are there specific union regulations or contract clauses that the system must accommodate?

5. **Branding Customization**: How important is white-labeling or custom branding for different organizations?

6. **Data Migration**: What existing data needs to be migrated from current systems? What are the data volumes?

7. **Training Preferences**: Do organizations prefer self-service video training or hands-on workshops for rollout?

8. **Performance Season Patterns**: What are the specific peak usage periods we should plan capacity for?

9. **International Expansion**: Is international support (multi-language, currency) a near-term priority that should influence architecture decisions?

10. **Offline Requirements**: How critical is offline functionality for the MVP, given technical complexity?
