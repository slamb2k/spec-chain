## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Global Edge Cases
1. **Network Connectivity Loss**
   - Scenario: User loses connection mid-action
   - Expected behavior: Graceful degradation, local save, queue for sync
   - User communication: "You're offline. Your work is saved and will sync when connected."

2. **Concurrent Editing**
   - Scenario: Multiple admins edit same user
   - Expected behavior: Last-write-wins with audit trail
   - User communication: "Another admin just updated this. Refreshing..."

3. **Session Timeout**
   - Scenario: User inactive for extended period
   - Expected behavior: Save state, require re-authentication
   - User communication: "Session expired for security. Please log in again."

4. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Scenario: SharePoint API limit reached
   - Expected behavior: Queue requests, retry with backoff
   - User communication: "System is busy. Your request is queued."

### Error Recovery Patterns
1. **Network Errors**
   - Retry mechanism: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
   - User feedback: Progress indicator with cancel option
   - Fallback option: Download for offline, email alternative

2. **Validation Errors**
   - Inline validation: Real-time as user types
   - Error messaging: Clear, actionable instructions
   - Field highlighting: Red border with error icon

3. **System Errors**
   - Graceful degradation: Core features remain available
   - Error logging: Automatic error reporting
   - User communication: Friendly error with support contact

## Accessibility Considerations

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance Matrix
| Feature | Level A | Level AA | Level AAA | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Authentication | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | AAA: Enhance error prevention |
| Contract Management | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | AAA: Add PDF text extraction |
| Expense Submission | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Complex forms challenging for AAA |
| Schedule View | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full compliance achieved |
| Mobile Design | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | AAA: Enhanced touch targets |
| Admin Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Complex data tables limit AAA |

### Assistive Technology Support
- **Screen Readers:** Full ARIA labeling, semantic HTML, skip navigation
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Tab order, shortcuts (J/K for next/prev), focus management
- **Voice Control:** Dragon NaturallySpeaking compatible, voice input for forms
- **High Contrast:** System preference detection, manual toggle, preserved preferences

## Localization and Internationalization

### Text Content Requirements
- **User-facing strings:** ~2,500 strings across all features
- **Date/time formats:** Locale-specific (MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY)
- **Number formats:** Decimal separators (1,234.56 vs 1.234,56)
- **Currency display:** Symbol placement, conversion tooltips

### Cultural Considerations
- Name ordering: First/Last vs Last/First for Asian markets
- Color meanings: Red for errors universal, green varies by culture
- Icon comprehension: Test icons across cultures, provide labels
- Right-to-left: Hebrew/Arabic support planned for Phase 2

## Testing Scenarios

2. **Workflow Automation:** Custom approval chains, automatic reminders, smart routing
3. **Advanced Analytics:** Predictive insights, anomaly detection, custom dashboards
4. **API Platform:** Public REST API, webhook framework, third-party integrations

### Long-term Vision
The platform will evolve into a comprehensive performing arts operations suite, expanding beyond artist management to include venue coordination, ticketing integration, donor management, and audience engagement tools. Machine learning will optimize scheduling, predict expense patterns, and automate routine tasks. The ultimate goal is to become the operating system for performing arts organizations worldwide.

## Critical Questions and Clarifications

1. **SharePoint Architecture Details**: Need specific SharePoint version (Online vs 2019/2016) and current folder structure to optimize integration approach.

2. **E-Signature Service Selection**: DocuSign vs Adobe Sign decision impacts implementation. Need cost analysis and feature comparison.

3. **Expense Category Taxonomy**: Current expense categories and approval matrix needed to design workflow accurately.

4. **Union Compliance Requirements**: Specific union rules affecting contracts and payments must be documented.

5. **Peak Load Specifications**: Exact dates and expected traffic for performance seasons to plan capacity.

6. **Data Migration Scope**: Volume of historical data and format for import from existing systems.

7. **Branding Requirements**: Level of customization needed per organization (logos, colors, domains).

8. **Payment Integration**: Whether direct payment integration is needed or just Xero sync sufficient.

9. **Mobile Device Minimum**: Oldest devices we must support (impacts feature availability).

10. **Audit Requirements**: Specific compliance needs for financial data retention and access logs.
