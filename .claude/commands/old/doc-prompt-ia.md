  - HTML files: Study functional organization including:
    ‚Ä¢ Navigation structures and menu hierarchies
    ‚Ä¢ Site/app organization and section grouping
    ‚Ä¢ Breadcrumb patterns and wayfinding
    ‚Ä¢ Category and subcategory structures
    ‚Ä¢ Search and filter organizations
    ‚Ä¢ User role-based navigation
  - Screenshots: Analyze functional hierarchy for:
    ‚Ä¢ Information grouping and categorization
    ‚Ä¢ Content organization patterns
    ‚Ä¢ Dashboard widget arrangements
    ‚Ä¢ Settings and preferences organization
    ‚Ä¢ Multi-level navigation structures
  - Dashboard examples: Note functional organization:

<task>
1. **Private reasoning:** Open an `<ia_planning>` tag. Inside it follow the <analysis_checklist>.
    ‚Ä¢ Study FUNCTIONAL navigation patterns in /assets/inspiration/functional/
    ‚Ä¢ Note successful information organization and categorization strategies
    ‚Ä¢ Extract menu structures, hierarchies, and navigation logic
    ‚Ä¢ Analyze content grouping and relationship patterns
    ‚Ä¢ Design logical groupings and hierarchies based on functional examples
    ‚Ä¢ Plan navigation patterns and wayfinding systems
    ‚Ä¢ Close `</ia_planning>` when done. Do **not** reveal its contents to the user.

2. **Public output:** After `</ia_planning>`, output *only* the Information Architecture Documentation using the Markdown structure found in <ia_template>. Fill every placeholder with detailed specifications.

3. **Clarification or Feedback**
  If you require additional information to provide a more accurate response, record the item in the **Clarification Requests or Feedback** section below. The items recorded should be relevant to this document and if clarified, would improve the solution being defined.
  
  Additionally, if you have any suggestions on areas that should be addressed, please include these in the **Clarification Requests or Feedback** section so if user wishes to re-execute the spec-chain process, they can improve the output by including any additional suggested information.

4. **Stop:** End the interaction once complete IA documentation has been delivered. Do not reveal chain-of-thought or planning notes at any stage.

- **Advanced Search**: Multiple criteria

### Search Results Organization
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Search["Search: query<br/>All Results (127)"] --> Type1["Content Type 1 (45)"]
    Search --> Type2["Content Type 2 (38)"]
    Search --> Type3["Content Type 3 (44)"]
    
    Type1 --> Result1["Result 1 with highlighted match"]
    Type1 --> Result2["Result 2 with highlighted match"]
    Type1 --> More1["Show more..."]
    
    Type2 --> Result3["Result 1 with highlighted match"]
    Type2 --> More2["Show more..."]
    
    Type3 --> More3["Show more..."]
```

### Search Filters
- Content Type
- Date Range
- Author/Owner
- Status
- Custom Attributes

## Permission-Based Architecture

### Role-Based Visibility
| Section | Admin | Manager | User | Guest |
|---------|-------|---------|------|-------|
| Dashboard | Full | Full | Limited | None |
| [Section 1] | Full | Full | Read | None |
| [Section 2] | Full | Edit | Read | None |
| Settings | Full | Limited | Personal | None |

### Adaptive Navigation
- Hide unavailable sections
- Disable without permission
- Show upgrade prompts
- Permission-based quick actions

## Mobile IA Considerations

### Mobile-First Sections
Priority order for mobile navigation:
1. [Most used feature]
2. [Second most used]
3. [Third most used]
4. [Fourth most used]
5. More... (everything else)

### Mobile-Specific Patterns
- Bottom tab navigation for primary actions
- Hamburger menu for secondary options
- Gesture-based navigation where appropriate
- Contextual actions in headers

## Growth & Scalability

### IA Extension Points
1. **New Features**: Add as subsections when related
2. **New Modules**: Create new primary sections
3. **Integrations**: Dedicated section or distributed
4. **Advanced Features**: Progressive disclosure

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Multi-tenant navigation needs
- [ ] Marketplace/plugin architecture
- [ ] Personalized navigation
- [ ] AI-driven suggestions

## Navigation Labels

### Primary Navigation Labels
| Section | Label | Mobile Label | Icon |
|---------|-------|--------------|------|
| Dashboard | Dashboard | Home | üè† |
| [Section] | [Full name] | [Short name] | [Icon] |

### Terminology Glossary
| System Term | User-Facing Label | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| [Term 1] | [Label 1] | [What it means] |
| [Term 2] | [Label 2] | [What it means] |

## Wayfinding Elements

### Breadcrumbs
Format: `Home > Section > Subsection > Current Page`

### Page Titles
- Clear, descriptive titles
- Include context when needed
- Match navigation labels
- Support for subtitles

### Status Indicators
- Current location highlighting

- Frequently accessed together

### Quick Actions
From any page, users can:
- Create new [primary content]
- Access recent items
- Search within context
- Switch between related items

## Implementation Guidelines

### Navigation Components

## Guidance Notes

When generating information architecture, ensure:

1. **User-Centered** organization based on mental models
2. **Scalable** structure that accommodates growth
3. **Findable** content through multiple paths
4. **Clear** labeling that users understand
5. **Consistent** patterns throughout the system
6. **Flexible** enough for different user types
7. **Mobile-Optimized** for smaller screens
8. **Accessible** navigation for all users
9. **Performant** without deep hierarchies
10. **Testable** with clear success metrics

Focus on creating an IA that:
- Users can navigate intuitively
- Scales with new features
- Supports different user journeys
- Minimizes cognitive load
- Enables efficient task completion
