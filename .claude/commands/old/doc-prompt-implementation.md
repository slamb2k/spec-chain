<task>
1. **Private reasoning:** Open an `<implementation_planning>` tag. Inside it follow the <analysis_checklist>.
    • Consider AI coding tool capabilities and limitations
    • Optimize batch sizes for context windows
    • Plan iterative, testable implementations
    • Close `</implementation_planning>` when done. Do **not** reveal its contents to the user.

2. **Public output:** After `</implementation_planning>`, output *only* the Implementation Plan using the Markdown structure found in <implementation_template>. Fill every placeholder with concrete, detailed content.

3. **Clarification or Feedback**
  If you require additional information to provide a more accurate response, record the item in the **Clarification Requests or Feedback** section below. The items recorded should be relevant to this document and if clarified, would improve the solution being defined.
  
  Additionally, if you have any suggestions on areas that should be addressed, please include these in the **Clarification Requests or Feedback** section so if user wishes to re-execute the spec-chain process, they can improve the output by including any additional suggested information.

4. **Stop:** End the interaction once a complete implementation plan has been delivered. Do not reveal chain-of-thought or planning notes at any stage.

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Claude Code Session

1. **Start with Clear Context**:
   ```
   I'm implementing [feature] for [App Name].
   Current status: [what's already built]
   Goal: [specific deliverables]
   Constraints: [any specific requirements]
   ```

2. **Request Comprehensive Implementation**:
   - Full code implementation
   - Tests for all functionality
   - Error handling
   - Documentation/comments
   - Type definitions (if applicable)

3. **Validation Checklist**:
   - [ ] Code runs without errors
   - [ ] Tests pass
   - [ ] Follows project conventions
   - [ ] Handles edge cases
   - [ ] Includes documentation

### Session Management Tips

1. **Context Preservation**:
   - Save all generated code immediately
   - Document decisions made
   - Note any TODOs for future sessions

2. **Incremental Progress**:
   - Each session should produce working code
   - Commit after each successful session
   - Maintain a session log

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - If session fails, start fresh with clear context
   - Reference previous code as needed
   - Break down complex tasks further

## Risk Mitigation

### AI-Specific Risks

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Context loss between sessions | Detailed session logs and clear handoffs |
| Inconsistent code style | Enforce linting and provide style guide |
| Missing edge cases | Comprehensive test requirements in prompts |
| Integration issues | Regular integration testing sessions |

## Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
- [ ] All deliverables completed
- [ ] Tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Integration verified

### Overall Project Success
- [ ] All features implemented
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] User acceptance achieved
- [ ] Production deployment successful

## Timeline Optimization

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Frontend and backend can be developed in parallel after API contracts defined
- Multiple entities can be implemented simultaneously
- Testing and documentation can happen alongside development

### Critical Path
1. [Foundation elements]
2. [Core features]
3. [Integration points]
4. [Production readiness]

## Human Review Points

### Required Reviews
1. **Architecture Review**: After Phase 1
2. **Security Review**: After authentication implementation
3. **API Review**: Before frontend implementation
4. **Code Quality Review**: After each phase
5. **Final Review**: Before production deployment

## Contingency Planning

### If Behind Schedule
1. Prioritize MVP features
2. Defer nice-to-have features
3. Increase session frequency
4. Bring in human developers for complex parts

### If Quality Issues
1. Add more specific test requirements
2. Implement stricter code review
3. Refactor problematic areas
4. Add integration test sessions

## Guidance Notes

When generating the implementation plan, ensure:

1. **Session Sizing** matches what can be accomplished in one Claude Code session
2. **Clear Prompts** provide all context needed for successful implementation
3. **Test-First** approach ensures quality and completeness
4. **Modular Design** allows independent development of features
5. **Documentation** is generated alongside code
6. **Integration Points** are clearly defined between sessions
7. **Human Review** points ensure quality and consistency
8. **Rollback Plan** exists for each phase
9. **Success Metrics** are measurable and specific
10. **Timeline** is realistic for AI-assisted development

Focus on creating a plan that:
- Developers can execute session by session
- Produces working code incrementally
- Maintains quality throughout
- Leverages AI strengths (rapid prototyping, comprehensive implementation)
- Mitigates AI limitations (context, consistency)
