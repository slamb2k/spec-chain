## Instructions

**PHASE 1: SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS & INSPIRATION SYNTHESIS**
Read and deeply understand all specification files in the OUTPUT_FOLDER:
- APP_DETAILS.md - Core application concept and requirements
- PRD.md - Product requirements and user journeys
- FEATURE_STORIES.md - Detailed user stories and UX considerations
- STYLE_GUIDE.md - Design system and visual language
- UI_STATES.md - Screen definitions and state variations

**Visual Inspiration Analysis** (`/assets/inspiration/visual/`):
- **Images**: Look at each image and extract:
  - Design emotions and energy levels
  - Spatial relationships and visual flow
  - Color psychology and mood creation
  - Interaction hints and micro-animations
  - What makes each design successful (principles, not pixels)
  
- **HTML Files**: Analyze code for:
  - Component architecture approaches
  - Animation implementation strategies  
  - Responsive design techniques
  - Performance optimization patterns
  - Accessibility implementation methods

- **PDF Files**: Study for:
  - Design system philosophy and structure
  - Documentation approaches for components
  - Visual language systematization
  - Brand expression methods

**Synthesis for Agent Directions**:
Create PARALLEL_AGENTS unique approaches by combining extracted principles (not copying implementations) into original design philosophies.

Think carefully about how to create `PARALLEL_AGENTS` unique and evolutionary UI design approaches that each explore different creative directions while maintaining spec compliance.

**PHASE 2: CONTEXTUAL CREATIVE DIRECTION MATRIX**

Generate truly distinct design directions by grounding each approach in the actual business context, target audience, brand personality, and design requirements extracted from the specification files (APP_DETAILS.md ➞ *Design Requirements* section, PRD user-journeys, FEATURE_STORIES personas, STYLE_GUIDE tokens, etc.).

### 2.1  Derive Core Context
For each agent, derive the following from the spec files:
1. **User Persona Archetype** (e.g. "Busy CFO", "College Creator", "Field Technician")
2. **Brand Personality Keywords** (e.g. "Professional & Calm", "Playful & Bold", "Trustworthy & Secure")
3. **Primary Usage Environment** (Web Desktop, Mobile Touch-first, Tablet Dashboard, etc.)
4. **Accessibility Priority** (low-vision, motor-impairment, cognitive load, etc.)

### 2.2  Create Direction Matrix
Build a matrix that combines:
- **Layout Archetype** (Grid Dashboard, Wizard Flow, Master-Detail, Command Palette, Feed Timeline, Card Kanban)
- **Interaction Focus** (Data Dense, Workflow Guided, Visual Story, Realtime Control, Form Intensive)
- **Visual Tone** (chromatic, monochrome, duotone, muted pastel, dark elevated, vibrant gradient)
- **Motion Vocabulary** (Subtle micro-interactions, Expressive physics, Minimal static, Data-driven anim)

Randomly (but deterministically) generate **PARALLEL_AGENTS** unique combinations **with these constraints**:
1. No two agents share the exact same combination of the four axes.
2. Each combination must align with **User Persona** & **Brand Personality** (e.g. corporate finance persona ✘ "Playful & Comic Sans").
3. Each combination must comply with STYLE_GUIDE color / typography unless the brief explicitly allows exploratory deviations.
4. If inspiration assets exist, bias selection toward patterns extracted in Phase 1 (e.g. if images show “Card Kanban” use that archetype in at least one combination).

Document the resulting table:
| Agent | Persona & Brand | Layout | Interaction Focus | Visual Tone | Motion |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| … |  |  |  |  |  |

### 2.3  Assign Rationales
For each agent include a one-paragraph **Rationale** that explains *why* this direction serves the persona and business goals, referencing at least one insight from the inspiration analysis (but **not** copying the design).

### 2.4  Output Brief for Each Agent
Provide every agent with a concise creative brief containing:
- **Design Goals** (functional + emotional)
- **Key References** (which extracted inspiration principles to lean on)
- **Must-Follow Tokens** (specific colors / typography from STYLE_GUIDE)
- **Differentiators** (what makes this design distinct from siblings)

Only after the matrix and briefs are produced, proceed to Phase 3.
Focus on the matrix-derived combinations only—do **not** rely on predefined lists that could lead to repetitive directions. Use real context (persona, brand, environment, accessibility) and inspiration insights to craft each unique creative direction.

For each of the `PARALLEL_AGENTS` agents, derive a distinct combination directly from:
- **User Persona & Brand Personality** insights
- **Layout Archetype** possibilities relevant to the app's workflows
- **Interaction Focus** that best serves key tasks
- **Visual Tone & Motion Vocabulary** aligned to the emotional goals

Avoid re-using directions from previous runs unless specifications force similarity. Each agent must justify any overlap by context (e.g. strict brand guidelines).

**PHASE 3: PARALLEL AGENT COORDINATION**
Deploy `PARALLEL_AGENTS` Sub Agents to generate UI previews in parallel for maximum creative diversity and comprehensive design exploration.

**Agent Assignment Protocol:**
Each Sub Agent receives:
1. **Spec Context**: Complete analysis of all specification files
2. **Creative Direction**: Specific design philosophy to explore
3. **File Assignment**: Generate `OUTPUT_FOLDER/UI_PREVIEW_[1-`PARALLEL_AGENTS`].html`
4. **Uniqueness Directive**: Explicit instruction to create distinct design approach
5. **Quality Standards**: Professional-grade interactive prototype requirements

**Agent Task Specification:**
```
TASK: Generate UI Preview [NUMBER] for [SPEC_NAME] in [OUTPUT_FOLDER]

You are Sub Agent [X] generating UI_PREVIEW_[NUMBER].html with [CREATIVE_DIRECTION] approach.

CONTEXT:
- Specification files: [Complete spec analysis]
- Your creative direction: [Specific design philosophy]
- Your file output: UI_PREVIEW_[NUMBER].html
- Platform requirements: Web, Mobile, Desktop (adapt as needed per app)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Read and understand all specification files completely
2. Implement your assigned creative direction while maintaining functionality
3. Create comprehensive interactive HTML prototype
4. Include platform-appropriate UI paradigms and interactions
5. Demonstrate key user workflows from the specifications
6. Ensure your design is genuinely unique from other agents' approaches

DELIVERABLE: Single self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS/JS
```
**Parallel Execution Management:**
- Launch all `PARALLEL_AGENTS` Sub Agents simultaneously using the task tool
- Monitor agent progress and completion
- Ensure each agent produces a unique design approach
- Validate all completed UI previews for quality and functionality
- Collect all `PARALLEL_AGENTS` HTML files in the OUTPUT_FOLDER

**PHASE 4: DYNAMIC AGENT COORDINATION**

For each of the `PARALLEL_AGENTS` Sub Agents (numbered 1 through `PARALLEL_AGENTS`):

**Dynamic Assignment Process:**
1. **Analyze Application Context**: Consider the app's purpose, target audience, and core functionality
2. **Select Unique Combination**: Choose 2-3 design elements from Phase 2 categories that haven't been used by previous agents
3. **Create Cohesive Direction**: Blend selected elements into a unified design philosophy
4. **Assign Innovation Focus**: Give each agent a specific aspect of UI innovation to push boundaries on
5. **Generate File Assignment**: Each agent creates `UI_PREVIEW_[NUMBER].html` where NUMBER ranges from 1 to `PARALLEL_AGENTS`

**Agent Differentiation Strategy:**
- Ensure no two agents explore the same combination of design elements
- Assign different emotional tones (energizing, calming, inspiring, professional, playful, etc.)
- Vary interaction complexity (simple/clean vs. rich/complex)
- Distribute across different user experience philosophies
- Balance between conservative and experimental approaches

**Innovation Dimensions to Distribute:**
- Layout innovation (grid systems, spatial relationships)
- Interaction innovation (gesture patterns, feedback mechanisms)
- Visual innovation (color theory, typography, iconography)
- Animation innovation (timing, easing, choreography)
- Accessibility innovation (inclusive design, universal usability)

**PHASE 5: TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL AGENTS**

Each Sub Agent must create a self-contained HTML file that includes:

**Core Requirements:**
- Self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- No external dependencies (all styles and scripts inline)
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Basic accessibility features (ARIA labels, focus management)

**Interactive Features:**
- Working navigation between screens (click buttons to move between states)
- Form interactions with validation feedback
- Loading states and transitions
- Error states and recovery flows
- Platform-specific interactions where applicable
- Modal/overlay interactions

**Workflow Demonstrations:**
- Implement key user journeys from start to finish
- Show how users complete primary tasks
- Include realistic demo data to make interactions meaningful
- Demonstrate the app's core value proposition

**EXECUTION PRINCIPLES:**

**Quality & Uniqueness:**
- Each UI preview must be genuinely unique and valuable
- Explore different design philosophies while maintaining functionality
- Ensure proper file organization and naming (UI_PREVIEW_1.html through UI_PREVIEW_`PARALLEL_AGENTS`.html)
- Maintain consistency with the original specifications

**Parallel Coordination:**
- Deploy Sub Agents strategically to maximize creative diversity
- Assign distinct design directions to each agent to avoid overlap
- Monitor all agents for successful completion and quality
- Ensure all `PARALLEL_AGENTS` previews provide different perspectives on the same application

Begin execution by launching all `PARALLEL_AGENTS` Sub Agents simultaneously, each with their specific creative direction and file assignment. The goal is to provide the product team with a comprehensive range of UI design approaches to experience and evaluate.

## Inspiration File Processing Guidelines

When processing files for visual or functional inspiration:

**For All File Types**:
1. **Understand Intent**: Why does this design/implementation work?
2. **Extract Principles**: What universal concepts can we learn?
3. **Consider Context**: How do our users and requirements differ?
4. **Innovate Forward**: How can we improve upon what we see?
5. **Synthesize Uniquely**: Combine insights into something original

**Images (Direct Vision Analysis)**:
- Claude can see and analyze images directly
- Extract emotional and design principles, not exact visuals
- Note what feelings and responses the design evokes
- Consider accessibility and inclusivity improvements

**HTML Files (Code Analysis)**:
- Read for patterns and approaches, not code to copy
- Understand the "why" behind implementation choices
- Extract architectural concepts and apply to our stack
- Learn from performance optimizations and accessibility

**PDF Files (Document Analysis)**:
- Study organization and communication methods
- Extract documentation and specification approaches
- Learn from systematic thinking and completeness
- Adapt formats and structures to our needs

**Creative Transformation Required**:
- Never replicate designs or code directly
- Always ask "How can this be better for our specific users?"
- Combine multiple inspirations into cohesive original direction
- Ensure legal and ethical distinctiveness

## Output Format

Generate `PARALLEL_AGENTS` distinct self-contained HTML files (UI_PREVIEW_1.html through UI_PREVIEW_`PARALLEL_AGENTS`.html) that serve as comprehensive interactive previews of the application. Each file should be immediately usable by opening in a web browser, with no external dependencies or build steps required.

Each preview should feel like a real application, not just static mockups. Users should be able to click through workflows, see transitions, and experience the unique character of each design approach.

## Success Criteria

**Diversity of Approaches**: The `PARALLEL_AGENTS` UI previews should explore genuinely different design philosophies while maintaining the same core functionality.

**Interactive Quality**: Each preview should demonstrate key user workflows with working interactions, transitions, and realistic demo data.

**Professional Polish**: All previews should meet professional standards for UI/UX design and implementation.

**Specification Compliance**: Each design should accurately implement the requirements from all specification files while expressing them through different creative lenses.

**User Experience Range**: The collection should provide the product team with a comprehensive range of potential user interface directions to evaluate and experience firsthand.

The goal is to provide the product team with `PARALLEL_AGENTS` unique, high-quality UI design options that each offer a different perspective on how the application could look, feel, and behave while serving the same user needs and business objectives.
