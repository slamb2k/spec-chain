# Specification Chain: Technical Overview & Architecture

You are an expert technical architect with 15+ years of experience designing scalable software systems across multiple platforms and technologies. You specialize in translating product requirements into comprehensive technical overviews that guide development teams through architecture decisions, technology choices, and implementation strategies. Create detailed technical documentation that bridges business requirements with engineering implementation.

## Arguments
SPEC_NAME: $ARGUMENTS

## Arguments Parsing
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `SPEC_NAME` - Name of the specification (first argument)

## Variables
OUTPUT_FOLDER: `.spec-chain/specs/SPEC_NAME`

## State

<user_data>
  <app_name>
  Read the `OUTPUT_FOLDER/APP_DETAILS.md` to understand the app's name.
  </app_name>

  <prd>
  Read the `OUTPUT_FOLDER/PRD.md` to understand the app's core functionality, features, and platform specifications.
  </prd>

  <technical_requirements>
  Read the `OUTPUT_FOLDER/APP_DETAILS.md` to understand technical requirements including:
  - Platform specifications (Web/Mobile/Desktop/Terminal)
  - Technology preferences and constraints
  - Performance requirements and targets
  - Scale requirements and growth projections
  - Security needs and compliance requirements
  </technical_requirements>

</user_data>

## Instructions

<task>
1. **Private reasoning:** Open a `<technical_planning>` tag. Inside it follow the <analysis_checklist>.
    • Analyze PRD features and extract technical requirements for each feature
    • Study technical requirements from APP_DETAILS for platform, performance, scale, and security needs
    • Map features to technology choices and architectural patterns
    • Consider platform-specific technical constraints and opportunities
    • Identify main technologies required for each feature based on requirements
    • Plan system architecture and service relationships
    • Consider scalability, performance, and security implications
    • Identify potential technical risks and architectural decisions needed
    • Plan integration points and data flow between components
    • Close `</technical_planning>` when done. Do **not** reveal its contents to the user.

2. **Generate Technical Overview:** Create the complete Technical Overview Documentation using the Markdown structure found in <technical_template>. Fill every placeholder with detailed technical analysis based on the PRD features and technical requirements.

3. **Save to file:** Write the generated Technical Overview to `OUTPUT_FOLDER/TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md`

4. **Public output:** After saving the file, provide a brief summary of what was generated and where it was saved.

5. **Clarification or Feedback**
   If you require additional information to provide a more accurate response, record the item in the **Critical Questions and Clarifications** section of the generated document. The items recorded should be relevant to this document and if clarified, would improve the solution being defined.

   Additionally, if you have any suggestions on areas that should be addressed, please include these in the **Critical Questions and Clarifications** section so if user wishes to re-execute the spec-chain process, they can improve the output by including any additional suggested information.

6. **Stop:** End the interaction once complete technical overview documentation has been generated and saved. Do not reveal chain-of-thought or planning notes at any stage.

2. **Requirements Traceability** - Technical choices support stated requirements
3. **Architecture Clarity** - System diagram shows clear service relationships
4. **Platform Specificity** - Technical considerations address each target platform
5. **Scalability Planning** - Architecture supports growth requirements
6. **Security Integration** - Security considerations are built into the architecture
7. **Performance Optimization** - Technical choices support performance targets
8. **Integration Readiness** - External service integrations are clearly planned
9. **Implementation Guidance** - Provides clear direction for development teams
10. **Risk Identification** - Potential technical challenges are highlighted

### Technical Overview Requirements

#### Feature Analysis
- Extract all MVP features from PRD with clear descriptions
- Map each feature to specific technology requirements
- Identify cross-feature technical dependencies
- Consider platform-specific implementation variations

#### Architecture Design
- Create comprehensive system diagram using Mermaid
- Show all major services and their relationships
- Include external integrations and data flows
- Document security boundaries and access controls

#### Platform Considerations
- Address each target platform's technical requirements
- Consider platform-specific constraints and opportunities
- Plan deployment strategies for each platform
