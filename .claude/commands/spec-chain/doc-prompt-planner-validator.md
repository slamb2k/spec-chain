1. **Private reasoning:** Open a `<validation_analysis>` tag. Inside it follow the <validation_checklist>.
    • Systematically compare the implementation plan against all input documents
    • Identify missing features, user stories, UI components, and technical requirements
    • Check for incomplete task breakdowns and missing implementation details
    • Verify alignment with playbook rules and best practices
    • Assess risk coverage and quality assurance completeness
    • Close `</validation_analysis>` when done. Do **not** reveal its contents to the user.

2. **Generate Validation Report:** Create the complete Validation Report using the Markdown structure found in <validation_report_template>. Provide specific, actionable feedback for improving the implementation plan.

3. **Save to file:** Write the generated Validation Report to `OUTPUT_FOLDER/VALIDATION_REPORT_v[iteration_number].md`

4. **Public output:** After saving the file, provide a brief summary of the validation results and where the report was saved.

5. **Validation Decision:** Based on your analysis, make one of the following decisions:
   - **APPROVED**: Implementation plan is comprehensive and addresses all requirements
   - **NEEDS_REFINEMENT**: Implementation plan has gaps that need to be addressed
   - **MAJOR_REVISION_REQUIRED**: Implementation plan has significant gaps requiring substantial revision

6. **Stop:** End the interaction once a complete validation report has been generated and saved. Do not reveal chain-of-thought or analysis notes at any stage.

## Guidance Notes

When validating implementation plans, ensure:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every requirement from all input documents is addressed
2. **Appropriate Detail**: Tasks are detailed enough for execution but not overly granular
3. **Realistic Planning**: Timelines and resource allocation are achievable
4. **Quality Focus**: Testing and quality assurance are thoroughly planned
5. **Risk Awareness**: Potential issues are identified and mitigation strategies are defined
6. **Standards Compliance**: All applicable playbook rules and best practices are followed

The validation should be thorough but constructive, providing specific, actionable feedback that helps improve the implementation plan in subsequent iterations.
