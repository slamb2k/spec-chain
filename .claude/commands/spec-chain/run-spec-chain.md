# Specification Chain: Runner

Execute the complete specification chain to generate comprehensive documentation for an app idea.

## Arguments

**Argument 1: Spec Name (Optional)**
- The name of the spec to create/update
- This becomes the output folder `/specs/<spec name>`
- If not supplied, defaults to timestamp format ("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
- If the folder already exists, its contents will be overwritten with newly generated documentation

**Argument 2: Start Phase (Optional)**
- The phase number to start execution from (1-5)
- Defaults to Phase 1 if not specified
- The system validates that all previous phase documents exist before proceeding
- If validation fails, the system will prompt to start from an earlier phase

## Usage Examples

**Basic usage (full generation with timestamp):**
```
@run-spec-chain
```
Creates: `/specs/20240120_143052/` with all documents

**Named spec (full generation):**
```
@run-spec-chain my-app
```
Creates: `/specs/my-app/` with all documents

**Resume from specific phase:**
```
@run-spec-chain my-app 3
```
Resumes generation from Phase 3 (Technical Architecture) in `/specs/my-app/`

**Update existing spec from Phase 3:**
```
@run-spec-chain existing-spec 3
```
Overwrites Phase 3+ documents in `/specs/existing-spec/`

## Overview

This runner orchestrates the execution of all 19 specification chain prompts in the correct order, managing dependencies and passing outputs between phases. The process transforms a single app idea into a complete documentation suite.

Each execution creates a directory under `/specs/` (e.g., `/specs/my-app/` or `/specs/20240120_143052/`) to:
- Preserve historical documentation versions
- Enable comparison between different generations
- Support iterative refinement without overwriting previous work
- Facilitate A/B testing of different approaches
- Maintain audit trail of documentation evolution

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Initialize APP_DETAILS.md

1. **Check for existing APP_DETAILS.md:**
   - Check if `/APP_DETAILS.md` exists in the project root
   - If it doesn't exist:
     - Copy `/APP_DETAILS.md.template` to `/APP_DETAILS.md`
     - Log: "Created APP_DETAILS.md from template"

2. **Parse APP_DETAILS.md structure:**
   - Read the APP_DETAILS.md file
   - Extract all sections and their current values
   - Identify REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL fields based on template annotations
   - Determine which fields are empty or contain placeholder text

### Step 2: Show Current Status Summary

Display a summary of the current APP_DETAILS.md status:

```
**APP_DETAILS.md Status Summary:**

**REQUIRED Fields:**
✅ App Name: [Current value or "❌ Missing"]
✅ App Idea: [Current value or "❌ Missing"]
✅ MVP Features: [Current value or "❌ Missing"]
✅ Target Users: [Current value or "❌ Missing"]

**OPTIONAL Fields:**
📝 Market Context: [Current value or "⚪ Empty - can auto-research"]
📝 Competition: [Current value or "⚪ Empty - can auto-research"]
📝 Business Model: [Current value or "⚪ Empty - can auto-research"]
📝 Constraints: [Current value or "⚪ Empty - can auto-research"]
📝 Platform: [Current value or "⚪ Empty - can auto-research"]
📝 Technology Preferences: [Current value or "⚪ Empty - can auto-research"]

📝 Development Team: [Current value or "⚪ Empty - can auto-research"]

**Summary:** [X] of [Y] required fields complete, [Z] optional fields have content
```

### Step 3: Gather Missing Required Information

For each missing REQUIRED field, ask ONE AT A TIME:

1. **App Name** (if missing):
   "What is the name of your app?"

2. **App Idea** (if missing):
   "What problem does your app solve? Please provide a brief description of your app concept."

3. **MVP Features** (if missing):
   "What are the core features for your minimum viable product (MVP)? List the essential functionality."

4. **Target Users** (if missing):
   "Who is the primary target audience for your app? Describe your main user types."

Wait for the user to answer each question before proceeding to the next.

### Step 4: Handle Optional Fields

Ask: "How would you like to handle the optional fields?

**Options:**
1. **Skip all** - Auto-research all empty optional fields (recommended for speed)
2. **Fill individually** - Go through each empty optional field one by one
3. **Skip remaining** - Available during individual filling to auto-research remaining fields

**Auto-research benefits:**
- Analyzes similar successful apps in your market
- Applies industry best practices and modern standards
- Generates contextually appropriate suggestions
- Ensures consistency across all documentation
- Often produces excellent results without manual input

**Choose:** (1=skip all, 2=fill individually)"

**If user chooses "1" (skip all):**
- Mark all empty optional fields for auto-research
- Skip to Step 5

**If user chooses "2" (fill individually):**
For each empty optional field, ask ONE AT A TIME:

1. **Market Context**: "Describe the market context and opportunity
   → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

2. **Competition**: "List key competitors and their positioning
   → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

3. **Business Model**: "Specify your business/monetization model
   → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

4. **Constraints**: "List any business or technical constraints
   → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

5. **Platform**: "Specify target platforms (Web/Mobile/Desktop/CLI)
   → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

6. **Technology Preferences**: "Specify technology preferences or constraints
   → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

7. **Performance Requirements**: "Define performance requirements and targets
   → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

8. **Scale Requirements**: "Specify expected scale and growth requirements
   → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

9. **Brand Personality**: "Describe your brand personality and values
   → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

10. **Visual Style**: "Describe your visual style preferences
    → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

11. **Accessibility Requirements**: "Specify accessibility requirements
    → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

12. **Integration Requirements**: "List required third-party integrations
    → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

13. **Success Metrics**: "Define success metrics and KPIs
    → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

14. **Go-to-Market Strategy**: "Describe your go-to-market approach
    → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

15. **Development Team**: "Specify team structure and requirements
    → Enter details (or type 'skip' to auto-research this field, 'skipall' to auto-research all remaining):"

**Response Processing:**
- If user types 'skip': Mark this field for auto-research and continue to next field
- If user types 'skipall': Mark all remaining fields for auto-research and proceed to Step 5
- Any other input: Use as the field value

### Step 5: Auto-Research and Finalize APP_DETAILS.md

1. **Perform Auto-Research for Marked Fields:**
   - If any fields were marked for auto-research, notify user: "Performing auto-research for skipped fields. This may take a moment..."
   - For each field marked for auto-research, generate appropriate content based on the app context:
     - **Market Context**: Research similar apps, market size, trends, and opportunities in the relevant industry
     - **Competition**: Identify 3-5 key competitors and their positioning
     - **Business Model**: Suggest appropriate monetization strategies based on app type and target users
     - **Constraints**: Identify common technical and business constraints for this type of application
     - **Platform**: Recommend optimal platform(s) based on target users and app functionality
     - **Technology Preferences**: Suggest modern, appropriate technology choices for the platform and requirements
     - **Performance Requirements**: Set industry-standard performance targets for the app type
     - **Scale Requirements**: Estimate appropriate scale targets based on target market and business model
     - **Brand Personality**: Generate brand attributes that align with the app idea and target users
     - **Visual Style**: Suggest design approaches that match the brand personality and user expectations
     - **Accessibility Requirements**: Apply modern accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
     - **Integration Requirements**: Identify likely third-party services needed for the app functionality
     - **Success Metrics**: Define relevant KPIs based on the business model and user goals
     - **Go-to-Market Strategy**: Develop launch and growth strategies appropriate for the target market
     - **Development Team**: Recommend team structure based on technical requirements and project scope

2. **Combine and Format Data:**
   - Merge existing data with newly gathered information and auto-researched content
   - Format according to the APP_DETAILS.md template structure
   - Ensure all sections are complete and properly formatted

3. **Save to Output Directory:**
   - Always save the complete APP_DETAILS.md to `$OUTPUT_DIR/APP_DETAILS.md`
   - This ensures all generation steps use the same comprehensive data

4. **Offer to Update Root File:**
   - Ask: "Would you like to update the APP_DETAILS.md file in your project root directory with this complete information? (yes/no)"
   - If yes: Save the updated content to `/APP_DETAILS.md`
   - If no: Keep the complete version only in the output directory
   - Log the user's choice and file locations

### Step 5: Proceed with Documentation Generation

The runner then uses **parallel Task agents** to execute independent prompts concurrently, significantly reducing total generation time:

```
Phase 1: Foundation (1 prompt)
    └── PRD.md

Phase 2: Feature Analysis & Technical Overview (2 prompts - parallel)
    ├── FEATURE_STORIES.md
    └── TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md (depends on PRD)

Phase 3: Design & UI/UX (2 prompts - sequential)
    ├── STYLE_GUIDE.md
    └── UI_STATES.md (depends on Style Guide)

Phase 4: Technical Architecture (1 prompt - sequential)
    └── TECHNICAL_SPEC.md (depends on Technical Overview)

Phase 5: Planning & Implementation Rules (1 step - sequential)
    └── Load Playbooks and Rules (depends on Technical Spec)
```

Total: 6 documents generated across 5 phases

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure all doc-prompt-*.md prompt files are present in the `.claude/commands/spec-chain/` directory
2. APP_DETAILS.md is optional - the system will:
   - Use existing `/APP_DETAILS.md` if present
   - Ask questions to gather missing information
   - Auto-research optional fields if not provided
3. Optionally, organize inspiration materials:
   - Place visual references in `/assets/inspiration/visual/` (colors, styles, typography, effects)
   - Place functional references in `/assets/inspiration/functional/` (layouts, workflows, interactions)

## Input Source

All input data is read from the `APP_DETAILS.md` file which contains:
- Basic Information (App Name, Idea, MVP Features)
- Target Users (Primary and Secondary)
- Business Context (Market, Competition, Model, Constraints)
- Technical Requirements (Platform, Technology, Performance, Scale)
- Design Requirements (Brand, Visual Style, Emotions, Accessibility)
- Feature Details (Workflows, Content Types, Priorities)

     - `START_PHASE`: Second argument (phase number) or default to 1 if not provided
   - **Set Output Directory:**
     - Set `OUTPUT_DIR=/specs/$SPEC_NAME`
     - Create output directory: `mkdir -p $OUTPUT_DIR`
     - If directory exists and contains files, log: "Overwriting existing spec directory: $OUTPUT_DIR"
   - **Initialize Data Sources:**
     - **Validate APP_DETAILS.md Structure:**
       - Check if `/APP_DETAILS.md.template` exists
       - If template exists, validate `/APP_DETAILS.md` structure against template
       - Extract section headers from template (excluding warning block): `sed '/^<!--$/,/^-->$/d' /APP_DETAILS.md.template | grep -E '^##|^###' | sort`
       - Extract section headers from current APP_DETAILS.md: `grep -E '^##|^###' /APP_DETAILS.md | sort`
       - Find missing sections: `comm -23 <(template_sections) <(current_sections)`
       - If missing sections found:
         - Log: "⚠️ Missing sections detected in APP_DETAILS.md"
         - Create backup: `cp /APP_DETAILS.md /APP_DETAILS.md.backup`
         - Append missing sections from template to APP_DETAILS.md
         - Log: "✅ Missing sections restored from template. Backup saved as APP_DETAILS.md.backup"
       - If no missing sections: Log: "✅ APP_DETAILS.md structure is complete"
     - Read APP_DETAILS from either `$OUTPUT_DIR/APP_DETAILS.md` (if newly created) or `/APP_DETAILS.md` (if existing)
     - Extract all sections for use in subsequent prompts
     - If `/assets/inspiration/visual/` directory exists, list its contents for visual design prompts
     - If `/assets/inspiration/functional/` directory exists, list its contents for functional design prompts

     ```

### Post-Generation: Clarification Aggregation

6. **Aggregate Clarification Requests**
    - After all documents have been generated, scan each document for clarification requests
    - For each generated document in `$OUTPUT_DIR`:
      - Read the document content
      - Search for the "## Clarification Requests or Feedback" section or "## Critical Questions and Clarifications" section
      - Extract any non-placeholder content (anything other than "[Any questions, clarifications or architectural considerations]")
      - If clarification items are found, record them with their source document
    - Compile all found items into a structured list organized by document
    - This aggregation will be included in the final Output Summary

## Output Summary

Upon completion, provide a summary including the following information. This summary should be both displayed in the prompt output AND saved to `$OUTPUT_DIR/README.md` for future reference:

1. **Generation Details**:
   - Spec name: `$SPEC_NAME`
   - Output directory: `$OUTPUT_DIR` (e.g., `/specs/my-app` or `/specs/20240120_143052`)
   - Generation mode: `[COLLABORATIVE/COMPREHENSIVE]` - indicates which approach was used
   - Start phase: `$START_PHASE`
   - Generation timestamp: `$TIMESTAMP`
   - Total execution time
   - Collaborative iterations: `[number]` (if COLLABORATIVE MODE was used)

2. **Generated Documents** (${#REQUIRED_DOCS[@]} total):
   - List each document with its full path in `$OUTPUT_DIR`
   - Brief description of contents
   - File size
   - **Note**: Only documents relevant to the application type were generated

3. **Documentation Coverage**:
   - **Generated Categories**: List categories of documents that were generated based on app requirements
   - **Skipped Categories**: List categories of documents that were skipped and why
   - **Foundation documentation**: PRD (always)
   - **Feature analysis**: Feature Stories (always), Technical Overview (always)
   - **Design documentation**: Style Guide, UI States (if UI-focused)
   - **Technical documentation**: Technical Spec (always)
   - **Planning documentation**: Playbook Rules Loading, Implementation Plan (always)
   - **Technical documentation**: Technical Spec (always), API (if client-server), Data Model (if data-focused), Security (if deployed), Integrations (if external deps), Performance (if deployed)
   - **Implementation documentation**: Implementation Plan (always), Testing (always), DevOps (if deployed), Onboarding (if UI-focused)
   - **Interactive assets**: Preview HTML (if UI-focused)

4. **Key Decisions Captured**:
   - Technology stack
   - Architecture patterns
   - Security approach
   - Deployment strategy

5. **Clarification Requests and Feedback Aggregation**:
   
   After all documents are generated, scan each document for its "Clarification Requests or Feedback" section and aggregate all items that were recorded. Present them organized by source document:
   
   **Clarification Items Found:**
   
   For each document that contains clarification requests:
   - **[Document Name]** (`$OUTPUT_DIR/[filename]`):
     - [Clarification item 1]
     - [Clarification item 2]
     - [etc.]
   
   If clarification items were found, include this note:
   > **Note:** The above clarification items indicate areas where additional information in APP_DETAILS.md would improve the generated documentation. Consider adding these details to APP_DETAILS.md and re-running the spec-chain process for more comprehensive results.
   
   If no clarification items were found:
   > **Note:** No clarification requests were recorded. The provided APP_DETAILS.md contained sufficient information for comprehensive documentation generation.

6. **Next Steps**:

   **For COLLABORATIVE MODE completions:**
   - Review the collaborative PRD in `$OUTPUT_DIR/PRD_COLLABORATIVE.md` (if generated)
   - Consider running again to graduate to comprehensive documentation
   - Use insights gained to refine APP_DETAILS.md for future comprehensive generation

   **For COMPREHENSIVE MODE completions:**
   - Review all documentation in `$OUTPUT_DIR`
   - Create symlink to latest generation (done automatically in summary output)
   - Gather stakeholder feedback on the comprehensive specification
   - Begin implementation using the Implementation Plan

   **For both modes:**
   - Address any clarification requests found in the generated documents
   - Update APP_DETAILS.md with new insights for future iterations

### Summary Output Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: After generating the complete summary above:

1. **Display the Summary**: Show the full summary in the prompt output for immediate viewing
2. **Save to README.md**: Write the identical summary content to `$OUTPUT_DIR/README.md` using the following format:

```markdown
# Spec Chain Documentation Generation Summary

Generated on: $TIMESTAMP
Output Directory: $OUTPUT_DIR

[INCLUDE THE COMPLETE SUMMARY CONTENT FROM ABOVE]

---

This documentation was generated by the Spec Chain system. All files in this directory represent a complete application specification suite based on the APP_DETAILS.md input file.
```

3. **Create Symlink**: Execute `ln -sfn $OUTPUT_DIR /specs/latest` to create a symlink pointing to this generation

## Error Handling

### General Prompt Failures
If any prompt execution fails:
1. Log the error with the specific prompt name
2. Continue with other prompts that don't depend on the failed output
3. Report all failures in the final summary
4. Suggest manual intervention for failed steps

### Collaborative Mode Specific Errors
If collaborative mode encounters issues:
1. **Iteration Loop Failures**: If user feedback integration fails, save the current state and offer to continue with existing PRD
2. **User Input Timeout**: If user doesn't respond within reasonable time, offer to proceed with current specification
3. **Invalid User Responses**: Gracefully handle unclear feedback and ask for clarification
4. **Graduation Failures**: If transition from collaborative to comprehensive fails, preserve collaborative PRD and suggest manual review

### Mode Detection Failures
If mode detection fails:
1. Default to COLLABORATIVE MODE for safety (less overwhelming)
2. Log the detection failure reason
3. Allow user to manually specify mode if needed
4. Provide clear explanation of why collaborative mode was chosen

## Intelligent Document Selection Examples

The system automatically determines which documents to generate based on app characteristics and selected mode:

### Collaborative Mode Example: Early-Stage Idea
**Mode**: COLLABORATIVE
**Input**: Basic app idea with minimal details
**Generated Documents** (1 total):
- PRD_COLLABORATIVE.md (focused 8-section collaborative PRD)

**Process**:
1. Generate initial collaborative PRD with critical questions
2. User provides feedback and clarifications
3. Iterate and refine the collaborative PRD
4. Option to graduate to comprehensive documentation

**Skipped Documents** (18 total): All other documents until graduation to comprehensive mode

## Customization Options

### Mode Selection
- **Auto-Detection** (Default): System automatically chooses COLLABORATIVE or COMPREHENSIVE based on APP_DETAILS.md completeness
- **Force Collaborative**: Override detection to use collaborative mode regardless of input completeness
- **Force Comprehensive**: Override detection to use comprehensive mode regardless of input completeness

### Document Generation
- **Force Full Generation**: Override intelligent selection to generate all 19 documents
- **Manual Selection**: Specify exact documents to generate via command line flags
- **Profile-Based**: Use predefined profiles (mobile-app, api-service, cli-tool, desktop-app)

### Collaborative Mode Options
- **Iteration Limit**: Set maximum number of collaborative iterations before auto-graduation
- **Auto-Graduate**: Automatically proceed to comprehensive mode after successful collaborative refinement
- **Save Iterations**: Preserve all collaborative iteration states for review

Remember: The PRD (collaborative or comprehensive) is always required as it feeds all other documents.
