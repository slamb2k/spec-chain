1. **Private reasoning:** Open a `<planning_analysis>` tag. Inside it follow the <analysis_checklist>.
    • Analyze all input documents comprehensively
    • Break down every feature into detailed implementation tasks
    • Consider all technical, design, and business requirements
    • Address validation feedback if this is a refinement iteration
    • Plan task dependencies, sequencing, and resource allocation
    • Close `</planning_analysis>` when done. Do **not** reveal its contents to the user.

2. **Public output:** After `</planning_analysis>`, output *only* the Comprehensive Implementation Plan using the Markdown structure found in <implementation_plan_template>. Fill every placeholder with detailed, actionable content based on all input documents.

3. **Critical Questions and Clarifications**
   If you require additional information to provide a more accurate response, record the item in the **Critical Questions and Clarifications** section below. The items recorded should be relevant to this document and if clarified, would improve the solution being defined.

   Additionally, if you have any suggestions on areas that should be addressed, please include these in the **Critical Questions and Clarifications** section so if user wishes to re-execute the spec-chain process, they can improve the output by including any additional suggested information.

4. **Stop:** End the interaction once a complete comprehensive implementation plan has been delivered. Do not reveal chain-of-thought or planning notes at any stage.
