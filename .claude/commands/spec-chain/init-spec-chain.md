# Initialize Spec Chain Project

This command initializes a new Spec Chain project by creating the required directory structure and template files.

## What This Command Does

1. Creates the required directory structure:
   - `.spec-chain/` - Root directory for all spec-chain files
   - `.spec-chain/specs/` - Where all generated documentation will be stored
   - `.spec-chain/assets/inspiration/visual/` - For visual design references
   - `.spec-chain/assets/inspiration/functional/` - For functional design references

2. Creates `.spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md` from the embedded template with:
   - Detailed comments explaining each section
   - Clear marking of required vs optional fields
   - Guidance on what information to provide
   - Template validation to ensure all required sections are present

## Execution Steps

### 1. Create Directory Structure

```bash
# Create main spec-chain directory and subdirectories
mkdir -p .spec-chain/specs 2>&1 || {
    echo "‚ùå Permission denied creating .spec-chain directory"
    echo ""
    echo "To fix this, add the following to your .claude/settings.local.json:"
    echo '{'
    echo '  "permissions": {'
    echo '    "allow": ['
    echo '      "Read(.spec-chain/**)",'
    echo '      "Write(.spec-chain/**)",'
    echo '      "Edit(.spec-chain/**)",'
    echo '      "MultiEdit(.spec-chain/**)"'
    echo '    ]'
    echo '  }'
    echo '}'
    echo ""
    echo "Then restart Claude Code and run /init-spec-chain again."
    exit 1
}

# Create inspiration directories
mkdir -p .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/visual
mkdir -p .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/functional

# Create placeholder files in inspiration directories
echo "# Visual Inspiration Assets

Place visual design references here:
- Screenshots showing color schemes, typography, visual styles
- UI mockups demonstrating visual aesthetics
- Brand guidelines or style references
- Images showing desired look and feel
- HTML files with CSS styles to extract

Visual elements to capture:
- Color palettes and gradients
- Typography (fonts, sizes, weights)
- Spacing and padding systems
- Border styles and shadows
- Button and form styling
- Animation and transition effects" > .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/visual/README.md

echo "# Functional Inspiration Assets

Place functional design references here:
- Screenshots showing layouts and information architecture
- Wireframes demonstrating component arrangements
- HTML files showing navigation structures
- Examples of forms, workflows, and user journeys
- Dashboard layouts and data displays

Functional elements to capture:
- Page layouts and grid systems
- Navigation patterns and menus
- Form structures and field arrangements
- Multi-step processes and wizards
- Data tables and list views
- Modal dialogs and overlays" > .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/functional/README.md
```

### 2. Create .spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md

Create `.spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md` if it doesn't exist, using the embedded template content below:

```bash
# Check if APP_DETAILS.md needs to be created
if [ ! -f ".spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md" ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Creating .spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md from template"
    echo "üìù Please fill out the required sections in .spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md"
    # Create the file with the template content (see below)
else
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  .spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md already exists"
    echo "‚úÖ Keeping existing .spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md"
fi
```

When creating `.spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md`, use the following template content:

```markdown

## Instructions for Use

1. **Fill out all REQUIRED sections** - These are essential for generating documentation
2. **OPTIONAL sections can be left blank** - The system will:
   - Research market context and competitors
   - Suggest appropriate technology stacks
   - Generate design guidelines
   - Create standard metrics and KPIs
   - Propose go-to-market strategies

3. **The more detail you provide, the more tailored the output** - While optional fields will be auto-filled, providing your specific requirements will result in more customized documentation

4. **Save this file as APP_DETAILS.md** in your project root directory
```

### 3. Create Success Message

After creating all files and directories, display:

```
‚úÖ Spec Chain project initialized successfully!

Created directories:
- .spec-chain/ (root directory for all spec-chain files)
- .spec-chain/specs/ (for generated documentation)
- .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/visual/ (for visual design references)
- .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/functional/ (for functional design references)

Created files:
- .spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md (application details template)
- .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/visual/README.md (visual inspiration guide)
- .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/functional/README.md (functional inspiration guide)

Next steps:
1. Fill out .spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md with your application details
   - The interactive information gathering will guide you through completing any missing fields
   - Fill out as many sections as possible for the most detailed generation
2. Add inspiration materials to the appropriate directories:
   - Visual designs ‚Üí .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/visual/
   - Functional examples ‚Üí .spec-chain/assets/inspiration/functional/
3. Run the spec-chain generator to create your comprehensive documentation

To generate documentation after setup:
- Use the run-spec-chain.md command (includes interactive information gathering and comprehensive generation)
- Use validate-spec-chain.md to check your setup and see readiness for generation
```

## Error Handling

Check if files/directories already exist before creating:
- If `.spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md` exists, validate structure against template and add missing sections
- If directories exist, skip creation but note they already existed
- Always use the embedded template content defined in this command
- Validate APP_DETAILS.md structure and restore missing sections from template
- Create backup before modifying existing .spec-chain/APP_DETAILS.md
- Report what was created vs what already existed vs what was validated/updated
