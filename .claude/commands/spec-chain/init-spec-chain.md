# Initialize Spec Chain Project

This command initializes a new Spec Chain project by creating the required directory structure and template files.

## What This Command Does

1. Creates the required directory structure:
   - `/specs/` - Where all generated documentation will be stored
   - `/assets/inspiration/visual/` - For visual design references
   - `/assets/inspiration/functional/` - For functional design references

2. Copies `APP_DETAILS.md.template` to create `APP_DETAILS.md` with:
   - Detailed comments explaining each section
   - Clear marking of required vs optional fields
   - Guidance on what information to provide
   - Template validation to ensure all required sections are present

## Execution Steps

### 1. Create Directory Structure

```bash
# Create main documentation output directory
mkdir -p /specs

# Create inspiration directories
mkdir -p /assets/inspiration/visual
mkdir -p /assets/inspiration/functional

# Create placeholder files in inspiration directories
echo "# Visual Inspiration Assets

Place visual design references here:
- Screenshots showing color schemes, typography, visual styles
- UI mockups demonstrating visual aesthetics
- Brand guidelines or style references
- Images showing desired look and feel
- HTML files with CSS styles to extract

Visual elements to capture:
- Color palettes and gradients
- Typography (fonts, sizes, weights)
- Spacing and padding systems
- Border styles and shadows
- Button and form styling
- Animation and transition effects" > /assets/inspiration/visual/README.md

echo "# Functional Inspiration Assets

Place functional design references here:
- Screenshots showing layouts and information architecture
- Wireframes demonstrating component arrangements
- HTML files showing navigation structures
- Examples of forms, workflows, and user journeys
- Dashboard layouts and data displays

Functional elements to capture:
- Page layouts and grid systems
- Navigation patterns and menus
- Form structures and field arrangements
- Multi-step processes and wizards
- Data tables and list views
- Modal dialogs and overlays" > /assets/inspiration/functional/README.md
```

### 2. Create APP_DETAILS.md from Template

Check if APP_DETAILS.md.template exists and copy it, with validation:

```bash
# Check if the template file exists
if [ -f "/APP_DETAILS.md.template" ]; then
    # If APP_DETAILS.md doesn't exist, copy the template
    if [ ! -f "/APP_DETAILS.md" ]; then
        # Remove the warning comment block from template when copying
        sed '/^<!--$/,/^-->$/d' /APP_DETAILS.md.template > /APP_DETAILS.md
        echo "‚úÖ Created APP_DETAILS.md from APP_DETAILS.md.template"
        echo "üìù Please fill out the required sections in APP_DETAILS.md"
    else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  APP_DETAILS.md already exists"
        echo "üîç Validating APP_DETAILS.md structure against template..."

        # Validate that all required sections exist
        # Extract section headers from template (excluding warning block)
        TEMPLATE_SECTIONS=$(sed '/^<!--$/,/^-->$/d' /APP_DETAILS.md.template | grep -E '^##|^###' | sort)
        CURRENT_SECTIONS=$(grep -E '^##|^###' /APP_DETAILS.md | sort)

        # Find missing sections
        MISSING_SECTIONS=$(comm -23 <(echo "$TEMPLATE_SECTIONS") <(echo "$CURRENT_SECTIONS"))

        if [ -n "$MISSING_SECTIONS" ]; then
            echo "‚ùå Missing sections found in APP_DETAILS.md:"
            echo "$MISSING_SECTIONS"
            echo ""
            echo "üîß Adding missing sections from template..."

            # Backup current file
            cp /APP_DETAILS.md /APP_DETAILS.md.backup

            # Merge missing sections from template
            # This is a simplified approach - in practice, you'd want more sophisticated merging
            echo "" >> /APP_DETAILS.md
            echo "# Missing sections added from template:" >> /APP_DETAILS.md
            sed '/^<!--$/,/^-->$/d' /APP_DETAILS.md.template | grep -A 10 -E '^##|^###' >> /APP_DETAILS.md

            echo "‚úÖ Missing sections added. Please review and fill out APP_DETAILS.md"
            echo "üìÑ Backup saved as APP_DETAILS.md.backup"
        else
            echo "‚úÖ APP_DETAILS.md structure is complete"
        fi
    fi
else
    echo "‚ùå APP_DETAILS.md.template not found. Creating basic template..."
    # Create a basic template if template doesn't exist
fi
```

If APP_DETAILS.md.example doesn't exist, create `/APP_DETAILS.md` with the following content:

```markdown

3. Place inspiration materials in the appropriate directories
4. Run the spec-chain generator to create comprehensive documentation
-->
```

### 3. Create Success Message

After creating all files and directories, display:

```
‚úÖ Spec Chain project initialized successfully!

Created directories:
- /specs/ (for generated documentation)
- /assets/inspiration/visual/ (for visual design references)
- /assets/inspiration/functional/ (for functional design references)

Created files:
- /APP_DETAILS.md (application details template)
- /assets/inspiration/visual/README.md (visual inspiration guide)
- /assets/inspiration/functional/README.md (functional inspiration guide)

Next steps:
1. Fill out /APP_DETAILS.md with your application details
   - The interactive information gathering will guide you through completing any missing fields
   - Fill out as many sections as possible for the most detailed generation
2. Add inspiration materials to the appropriate directories:
   - Visual designs ‚Üí /assets/inspiration/visual/
   - Functional examples ‚Üí /assets/inspiration/functional/
3. Run the spec-chain generator to create your comprehensive documentation

To generate documentation after setup:
- Use the run-spec-chain.md command (includes interactive information gathering and comprehensive generation)
- Use validate-spec-chain.md to check your setup and see readiness for generation
```

## Error Handling

Check if files/directories already exist before creating:
- If `/APP_DETAILS.md` exists, validate structure against template and add missing sections
- If directories exist, skip creation but note they already existed
- Always prefer copying from `APP_DETAILS.md.template` if it exists
- Validate APP_DETAILS.md structure and restore missing sections from template
- Create backup before modifying existing APP_DETAILS.md
- Report what was created vs what already existed vs what was validated/updated
