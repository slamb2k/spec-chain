# Validate Spec Chain Setup

This command validates that all required files, directories, and fields are properly configured for the Spec Chain documentation generator.

## What This Command Validates

1. **Directory Structure**: Checks for required directories
2. **File Existence**: Verifies all necessary files are present
3. **APP_DETAILS.md Completeness**: Validates that all required fields are populated
4. **Inspiration Assets**: Checks for presence of inspiration materials
5. **Previous Generations**: Reviews documentation history

## How Validation Works

This command uses Claude Code's file system tools (Read, LS, Glob) to perform all validations without requiring user confirmation or executing shell commands. The validation process:

1. Checks each required directory using the LS tool
2. Reads files to verify content and structure
3. Uses pattern matching to validate field completeness
4. Generates a comprehensive report with clear status indicators

## Validation Process

### 1. Directory Structure Check

The following directories are validated:
- `/specs` - For generated documentation output
- `/assets/inspiration/visual` - For visual inspiration materials
- `/assets/inspiration/functional` - For functional inspiration materials
- `/.claude/commands/spec-chain` - For spec-chain command files

### 2. Required Files Check

Validates the existence and quality of:
- **APP_DETAILS.md.template** - The template file for project configuration
- **APP_DETAILS.md** - The actual project configuration file
- **Spec-chain prompts** (8 files in `.claude/commands/spec-chain/`)

### 3. APP_DETAILS.md Content Validation

Examines each required field for:
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Field header not found
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Empty**: Contains only placeholders or instructions
- ‚úÖ **Filled**: Contains substantial content

### 4. Inspiration Assets Check

Counts and categorizes files in inspiration directories:
- Images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF)
- HTML files
- PDF documents

### 5. Readiness Analysis

Based on APP_DETAILS.md completeness:
- **< 50% Complete**: Recommends completing interactive information gathering first
- **‚â• 50% Complete**: Ready for comprehensive documentation generation

### 6. Summary Report

Provides:
- Total counts of errors, warnings, and passed validations
- Specific recommendations based on findings
- Clear next steps for addressing any issues

## Output Format

The validation report uses:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmarks for passed validations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning symbols for non-critical issues
- ‚ùå Red X marks for critical failures
- üìÅ üìÑ üìã üé® üìä üìà Icons for different sections
- Formatted tables for clear presentation

## Success Criteria

Validation is successful when:
- All required directories exist
- APP_DETAILS.md exists with substantial content
- All 8 spec-chain prompts are present
- No critical errors are found

## Error Handling

- Missing directories or files are clearly reported
- Specific fixes are suggested for each issue
- Validation continues even if some checks fail
- Non-critical warnings don't prevent documentation generation
