  </visual_inspiration>
</user_data>

## Instructions

<task>
1. **Private reasoning:** Open a `<states_planning>` tag. Inside it follow the <analysis_checklist>.
    • Analyze PRD to understand app features and user workflows
    • Extract feature stories to understand user interactions and UX considerations
    • Study style guide for visual design patterns and component behaviors
    • Plan UI states for each feature based on user journeys and interactions
    • Consider different screen sizes, device types, and accessibility needs
    • Design state transitions that feel natural and provide clear feedback
    • Plan loading states, error handling, and edge case scenarios
    • Consider animation and motion design for state transitions
    • Ensure consistency across all states using the design system
    • Close `</states_planning>` when done. Do **not** reveal its contents to the user.

2. **Generate UI States:** Create the complete UI States Documentation using the Markdown structure found in <states_template>. Fill every placeholder with detailed state descriptions based on the feature stories and style guide.

3. **Save to file:** Write the generated UI States to `OUTPUT_FOLDER/UI_STATES.md`

4. **Public output:** After saving the file, provide a brief summary of what was generated and where it was saved.

5. **Critical Questions and Clarifications**
   If you require additional information to provide a more accurate response, record the item in the **Critical Questions and Clarifications** section of the generated document. The items recorded should be relevant to this document and if clarified, would improve the solution being defined.

   Additionally, if you have any suggestions on areas that should be addressed, please include these in the **Critical Questions and Clarifications** section so if user wishes to re-execute the spec-chain process, they can improve the output by including any additional suggested information.

6. **Stop:** End the interaction once complete UI states documentation has been generated and saved. Do not reveal chain-of-thought or planning notes at any stage.

## Guidance Notes

When generating UI states documentation, ensure:

1. **Comprehensive State Coverage** - Document all possible states for each feature and screen
2. **Visual Consistency** - Apply style guide colors, typography, and components consistently
3. **User-Centered Design** - Focus on how states serve user goals and provide clear feedback
4. **Responsive Design** - Consider how states adapt across different screen sizes and devices
5. **Accessibility First** - Ensure all states are accessible with proper contrast, focus, and screen reader support
6. **Performance Awareness** - Design states that load quickly and provide appropriate feedback
7. **Error Prevention** - Plan states that help users avoid mistakes and recover gracefully
8. **Animation Purpose** - Use motion to enhance understanding and provide feedback, not decoration
9. **Platform Conventions** - Follow established patterns for the target platforms
10. **Implementation Clarity** - Provide detailed specifications that developers can implement precisely

### UI States Documentation Requirements

#### State Categories
- **Default States** - How screens appear initially
- **Loading States** - How processing and data fetching are communicated
- **Success States** - How successful actions are confirmed
- **Error States** - How errors are displayed and recovery is enabled
- **Empty States** - How screens appear with no data
- **Interactive States** - How elements respond to user interactions

#### Visual Specifications
- Use exact colors from the style guide with hex codes
- Specify typography styles with font sizes, weights, and line heights
- Detail component styling including padding, margins, and borders
- Include spacing values from the design system
- Describe animations with timing and easing functions

#### Responsive Considerations
- Document how states adapt to different screen sizes
- Consider touch interactions for mobile devices
- Plan for orientation changes and viewport variations
- Ensure touch targets meet minimum size requirements

#### Accessibility Requirements
- Ensure WCAG AA compliance for all states
- Document focus states for keyboard navigation
- Consider screen reader announcements for state changes
- Maintain sufficient color contrast in all states
- Plan for reduced motion preferences

#### Animation Guidelines
- Use consistent timing and easing functions from the style guide
- Design purposeful animations that enhance usability
- Consider performance implications of animations
- Respect user preferences for reduced motion
- Plan for graceful degradation on slower devices

The UI states documentation should serve as a comprehensive guide for designers and developers to implement consistent, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces that align with the overall design system and user experience goals.
