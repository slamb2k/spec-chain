# Comprehensive Implementation Plan: BIG Live Portal

## Executive Summary
The BIG Live Portal implementation follows a phased approach over 6 months to deliver a Progressive Web Application that revolutionizes performing arts management. The plan emphasizes mobile-first development, early integration with critical external services (SharePoint, e-signature providers), and iterative feature releases to gather user feedback. By structuring development into 5 distinct phases - Foundation & Infrastructure, Core System Development, Feature Implementation, Integration & Testing, and Deployment & Launch - the team can deliver a production-ready platform supporting 1,000+ concurrent users with sub-500ms response times while maintaining 99.9% uptime.

## Critical Questions and Clarifications

1. **SharePoint Permission Model**: Should the platform inherit SharePoint permissions for documents, or maintain its own permission system? This affects the depth of integration required and could impact timeline by 1-2 weeks.

2. **Offline Functionality Scope**: Which specific features must work offline beyond viewing contracts and drafting expenses? Full offline support for all features would add 3-4 weeks to the timeline.

3. **Multi-Organization Architecture**: Do artists need to work with multiple organizations simultaneously? This would require significant changes to the data model and authentication system, adding 2-3 weeks.

4. **Peak Load Handling Strategy**: Should the system auto-scale for the 3x peak season load, or can we pre-scale based on known patterns? Auto-scaling adds complexity but reduces costs during off-peak times.

5. **E-Signature Provider Priority**: Between DocuSign and Adobe Sign, which should be the primary integration? Having both would add 1 week but provide redundancy.

6. **Compliance Requirements**: Are there specific union or industry regulations beyond standard data protection that would require custom workflows? This could add 2-4 weeks depending on complexity.

7. **Data Migration Scope**: How much historical data needs to be migrated from existing systems? Large-scale migration could add 2-3 weeks to the timeline.

8. **Custom Branding Depth**: Should each organization have full visual customization capabilities, or just logo/color changes? Full customization would add 1-2 weeks.

9. **Notification Granularity**: Should notification preferences be user-level or organization-level? User-level adds complexity but improves user satisfaction.

10. **Beta Customer Selection**: Are the 3-5 beta organizations already identified? Having committed beta customers affects the beta phase timeline and feedback quality.
