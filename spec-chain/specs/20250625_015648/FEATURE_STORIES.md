## Critical Questions and Clarifications

1. **Multi-Organization Support**: Should the platform support artists who work with multiple organizations simultaneously? This would affect the navigation structure and data isolation approach.

2. **Approval Workflow Complexity**: What level of customization is needed for expense approval chains? Should organizations be able to create custom multi-level approval workflows based on amount, category, or other criteria?

3. **Schedule Integration Depth**: Should the platform support two-way calendar sync with external calendars (Google, Outlook), or is one-way export sufficient for the MVP?

4. **Contract Template Management**: Do administrators need the ability to create and manage reusable contract templates within the platform, or will all contracts be uploaded as complete documents?

5. **Notification Granularity**: What level of control should users have over notifications? Should preferences be managed at the user level, organization level, or both?

6. **Expense Policy Enforcement**: Should the platform enforce expense policies (per diem limits, category restrictions) automatically, or simply facilitate the approval process?

7. **Performance Season Handling**: How should the platform handle the 3x load during performance seasons? Should there be special "performance mode" optimizations?

8. **Artist Onboarding Variations**: Are there different onboarding requirements for union vs. non-union artists that would require separate workflows?

9. **Data Retention Policies**: What are the specific requirements for contract retention (mentioned as 7 years) and how should the platform handle automated archival?

10. **Accessibility Testing**: Beyond WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, are there specific accessibility scenarios (low vision, motor impairments) that are particularly important for the artist community?

These clarifications would help refine the feature stories and ensure the platform fully meets the needs of performing arts organizations and their artists.
